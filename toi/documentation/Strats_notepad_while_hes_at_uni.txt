Boom Bust Cycles:
    Consumer Confidence affects target spending
    If pops overspend -> accumulate debt

    110 confidence:

    1000 income -> 1100 spending
    100 debt accumulation
    10% interest?

    After 1 yr: 1000 debt, 100 yrly debt payment, ~8 per month

    Under 100 confidence, underspending, results in paying off debt
    Higher interest payment -> decreases consumer confidence
        % of income that is debt payment reduces cons confidence by that amount?
    
    8 per month means 0.8 consumer confidence reduction
        this means 8 of target spending is spent on interest and target spending gets reduced by 8 as well
        so spending goes down by about 1.6%

    If pops are under 100 CC, they will start withdrawing from savings instead of borrowing money
    Reducing SoL due to overspending takes longer than increasing SoL

    If pops cannot borrow/withdraw, then their target spending & SoL will drop like a rock

Savings
    Banking Confidence determines the excess cash (that gets dumped into increasing SoL) that gets put into savings
    Savings can be withdrawn in times of stress

    Building cash reserves also count as savings
    Investment Fund can also dump excess cash into the bank
    
    All sources of savings earn money from interest on debt currently lent out


State Banks
    Pops' and Buildings' savings will accumulate in state banks
    Investment Fund savings will accumulate in the national bank

    Pops & Buildings will borrow from state banks

    Disabled by default

National Bank
    Countries borrow from the national bank. It's an accumulation of the state banks (for ease of calculation)

    If a state doesn't have a state bank, then a penalty is applied to the amount transferred over to the national level

Central Banking
    Only available if you have Private/Public Central Banking or Nationalized Banking

    Having a central bank will allow state banks to borrow from the central bank to correct pitfalls
    Also allows setting the interest rate for domestic borrowing (which affects spending)
    State banks will borrow money until their interest rate is just above the national rate
        They will pay back money if it's below that


Credit Rating
    Risk of lending to a particular group/individual
    Each potential borrower is given a credit rating (AAA to SD/D) (100.0-0.0) to assess risk
        >=90 = AAA
        >=80 = AA
        >=70 = A
        >=60 = BBB
        >=50 = BB
        >=40 = B
        >=30 = CCC
        >=20 = CC
        >=10 = C
        <=00 = SD/D

    Based upon earnings (with different weights given to various sources), current interest payment % of modified revenue, 
    current available credit, current spending (modified based on sources. More weight given to permanent spending than temporary)
        Power ranking also affects this. Regionals & Great Powers get higher scores automatically

    Higher risk = higher interest rate

    For countries, higher credit ratings allow greater & cheaper access to borrowing from foreign nations
    It essentially will provide a cap, probably based on a function of (solid) revenue

    For pops/investment fund, credit ratings affect behavior. 
    Low credit ratings (below A) will spur pops to cut spending, or even make withdrawals (below B)
    Same with investment funds

Bank Run
    The higher your banking confidence, the harder this will hit
    
    If the bank isn't bailed out, it fails. This can cause a chain of failures
        Enable like a panic modifier

    Tanks your banking confidence, increases interest rates

Default
    A state any borrower can go in. It means that they have reached the maximum amount they can borrow and cannot
    borrow any further.

    For countries, it will give a scaling modifier which will be more ruinous the less you can fund your govt
        and an event every month you are in default

    Bankruptcy can then follow. It will wipe the debts & the savings attached to that debt.
    For countries, it will give a nasty modifier.

    A country can only go bankrupt if it's below a B rating
