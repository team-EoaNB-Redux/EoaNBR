Pops with a whole system dedicated to them. Policies to direct change in your economy and population, not only that but that set rules for both you and your population and businesses. And, of course, events that will reflect circumstances in your country: economic crashes, protests, strikes, etc.\n\nSo put on your top-hat and don a cigar, come witness the industrialization and modernization of your nation in Debt and Taxes."
 STARTUP_EVENT_PIERCED_WINGS: "§CPierced Wings§!"
 STARTUP_EVENT_PIERCED_WINGS_tt: "Pierced Wings, a project for HOI4, is a grime-struck nightmare where the spirit of human freedom has succumbed at the heels of her overlords. Infernal machines of war roll off assembly lines. Manufacturing plants tower to the clouds, with aerostats dotting between the waiting piers. Smog divides the sky. Inspired by properties such as the Dishonored games and the Leviathan series of novels.\n\nFollowing a Grand Alliance decisive victory in the War of Spanish Succession, a premature French Revolution is crushed in the cradle. America remains under the Britannic yoke. Democracy perishes. The world languishes. In these times the flame of ingenuity lights as Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace complete their masterstroke on the pages of history, and the Difference Engine roars to life.\n\nPainted in hues of watercolor and ink, an exploration of a universe in the transition between steampunk and dieselpunk. Bent askew by the introduction of the power to defy sacrosanct Heaven, humanity stands on the precipice of a fate worse than death.\n\nWe humbly invite you to take this journey into hell with us, where the brightest lights have been snuffed out. We await your arrival eagerly."
