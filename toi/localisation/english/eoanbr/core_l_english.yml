    institution_industrialization: "Industrialization"
    institution_industrialization_desc: "Industrialization, or the Industrial Revolution, was a period from the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries in which a transition from hand production methods to machines occurred, as well as increased use of steam and water power. It also boosted the use of textiles, as the textile industry was the first to use these modern production methods. The start of the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, as most of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin and design. The Industrial Revolution was one of the most major turning points in history, second only to the adoption of agriculture."

    institution_mechanization: "Mechanization"
    institution_mechanization_desc: "Mechanization involves the mass transition from hand production methods to machines. Once this is completed, the speed at which we can produce things will increase by a lot due to the automatic process that these machines have. We can use things such as steam or water to help further the automatic process. Alongside these developments, the idea of heavy industrialization will spread further amongst the nations, as they attempt to keep up with the rest of the world."

    institution_green_revolution: "Green Revolution"
    institution_green_revolution_desc: "Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, new and efficient food production methods were introduced into developing countries, which led to a significant rise in the production of staple grains (particularly wheat and rice). Significant quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides achieve much higher crop yields, which raises concerns about its expense and potential impact on the environment. Also, poor farmer' harvests now have comparatively lower yields under these new developments because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides."

    institution_automation_desc: "Automation refers to a broad spectrum of technologies that minimize human involvement in processes. When decision criteria, subprocess linkages, and related actions are predetermined and implemented into machines, the need for human intervention is decreased. A massive industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals is one example of automation, but it can also refer to smaller applications like a thermostat controlling a boiler. Control complexity can vary greatly, from straightforward on-off control to high-level multivariable algorithms simplified for easy everyday use."

They were founded by social reformers who believed that urbanization brought social problems, such as poverty and crime, and sought to address them through community-based solutions. Settlement institutions offer a wide range of services, including adult education, childcare, recreation, health services, and advocacy. They continue to play an important role in building strong, healthy communities and promoting social justice."

This type of institution is common in both the public and private sectors, where decisions are made by a small group of individuals at the top of the organization, rather than distributed throughout the organization. The centralization of authority can provide several benefits, such as faster decision-making, greater consistency in policies and procedures, and better coordination of resources. However, it can also lead to bureaucracy, lack of innovation, and a disconnect between decision-makers and those who are affected by their decisions. As such, the benefits and drawbacks of centralized institutions depend on the specific context and the needs of the organization."
