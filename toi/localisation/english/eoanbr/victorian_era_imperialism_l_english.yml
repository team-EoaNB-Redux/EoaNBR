# The Sepoy Rebellion
 eoanb_category_sepoy_rebellion: "The Sepoy Rebellion"
 eoanb_category_sepoy_rebellion_desc: "§RMutinies in the Army§!: The rebellion sweeping across India began as a series of mutinies among the Sepoys, Indian musketmen in the service of the British East India Company. Initially a small skirmish, the mutiny has quickly grown into a wider conflict with uprisings across many barracks and townships across Northern India. Cultural missteps, economic strain, and religious policies perceived as deeply intrusive have disrupted a delicate balance maintained by the ever growing Briish East India Company, igniting widespread discontent amongst the peoples under the reign of the Company.\n\nNow, villages have risen in rebellion, towns rally to for and against the Company’s cause, and the landscapes of the Ganges Delta have become a patchwork of loyalties. Though the Company’s administration struggles to maintain order, the outcome remains uncertain. For now, the rebellion threatens to reshape not just the British dominance within the region, but the future governance of the subcontinent itself."
