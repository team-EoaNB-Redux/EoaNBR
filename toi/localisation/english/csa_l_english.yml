Now they claim to be the true Democratic Party. Naturally, we have far more Democratic Party support in the South, as many Nothern Democrats joined the Republican Party during the Election of 1860. But, there are some who have come up with an idea for a new party, the Dixiecrats. It signifies who we are, but adopting this name would mean that we give up the name and legacy of the Democratic Party to the traitors in the North."
