  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_NAME: "The End of a New Beginning"
  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_DESC: "The turbulent waves of time splash against the crumbling empires of old as the kingdoms of a dawning golden era arise. The Conference of Vienna in 1815 established the United Kingdom as a global overseer, as it is said on the British Isles and its ever-expanding empire: "a power incomparable and without hindrance, one without peer or challenge, as nobody dares to face Her Majesty's Royal Navy." While the British Empire reigns as the world's premier power, behind the shadows of the autonomous, yet fragmented, German and Italian states, the cries of liberty and unification have echoed since the Revolutions of 1848.\n\nIn the lands of the New World, the demise of the Spanish and Portuguese empires gave rise to the many new states of South America, and their consolidation still causes conflicts. To the north, the United States, the so-called "Land of the Free," is troubled with the issue of slavery and the ramifications of Manifest Destiny at the expense of the native populations in the west. In the Far East, the Shogun's power is questioned by the Bakufu Council, and the guns of Perry and the West force the nation to sign unequal treaties, whilst another war over opium and trade looms over China and the Great Powers question the authority of the Qing and their vassals.\n\nRecent conflicts have reshaped and plotted out the lines of influence; damned be those who have become ensnared in the ever-expanding spheres of damnation. But there are many ancient nations lurking across the ever-industrializing world, ready to be explored and conquered, or to be led to victory. For it is neither the end, nor the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the End of a New Beginning."
  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_OTHER: "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPax-Britannica, as it is said on the isles of Great Britain and its ever-expanding empire; a power incomparable and lacking hindrance, one without peer nor challenge as nobody dares face Her Majesty's Armada. Its victims suppose elsewise, coining the era instead as Imperium-Britannica, or British Eminence.\n\nAcross the world, changes have come only in swift motions. Behind the shades of the autonomous, yet fragmented states in Europe and South America, the cries of liberty and unification have echoed since the Revolutions of 1848.\n\nRecent conflicts have reshaped and plotted out the lines of influence; damned be those who have become ensnared in the ever-expanding spheres of damnation. But there are many ancient nations lurking across the ever-industrializing world, ready to be explored and conquered, or to be led to victory..."

The Crown shines as the sun that never sets upon the very edges of the known world, and each British frontier serves as a jewel in it. The world changes, however; the final jewel of India begins to crack under pressure. Religious conflicts have inflated to the point of threatening the position of the undefeatable Empire, and when one colony topples the rest may follow.\n\nNow the most feared has happened, the rebels have captured Delhi, and established a base. Britain still has plenty of men at her disposal, but without caution this very mutiny could lead to the downfall of India."

  bookmark_1857_OTO_situation: "On a continent where modernization is advancing quickly, the Ottomans spent the last century trying to catch up with Westernization. Despite the fact that the "Sick Man of Europe" had narrowly won the Crimean War with the help of the Western powers against the Russians, it was clear that the Ottomans were on the verge of collapse and that nothing could stop this path. The reign of the elderly Abdulmecid I soon comes to an end, and with it, his reforms. The next several decades will be critical to the Ottomans' survival as they embark on a lengthy journey of hardships, and if the crumbling empire were to preserve governmental stability above all else and choose political and financial movements very carefully, there might be light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThe future is uncertain for the Ottomans, and with every opportunity comes a threat. It will have to be careful, as one misplaced gust of wind may be all it takes to topple the Grand Sultanate of Osman."

However, even within the German Confederation, the rivalry between Prussia and the Austrian Empire troubles the weakly confined states. With King Frederick William's health on the line, the nation is more vulnerable than ever.\n\nDespite this, all German people recognize Prussia's strength, and it is time to prove how it can be used."

The Qing have remained as the greatest power of the east for millennia, and in the span of decades their strength has not only been challenged, but proved futile against imperialism and colonialism. Not much has changed since the first war, and now the Chinese have to protect their sovereignty and the Holy Mandate to their lands. \nAn uneasy position remains for the Empire, as like many whom once were undefeatable but collapsed under change."
  POLITICS_XIANFENG_DESC: "The Xianfeng Emperor, Wenzong of Qing, was and is sitting on a powderkeg from the moment he ascended the throne. Yizhu, as he was known, came to power in 1831, at the age of just 19, into an empire hassled by threats from within and across its borders. In the midst of the turbulent period, the Taiping Rebellion threatened to tear the country apart. Relying on incompetent generals, the Emperor’s forces have been pushed to defeat for several crucial and brutal battles whose casualties would make a civilized nation shudder in fear. At the same time, failed diplomacy brought conflict from the forces of the British and French, who seek treaties with the government that will push China into subservience to the Western powers. With these conflicts pushing his government to the brink, and political infighting a common practice in his court, outside observers struggle to accept any other conclusion besides one; that the Xianfeng Emperor, barring an incredible turn of events, is the wrong monarch for the situation."

  bookmark_1857_SPR_situation: "Following the Napoleonic Wars, the nation of Spain began gradually losing power and influence in European politics, to the point of remaining little more than a shadow of its former imperial glory. The situation of political fragmentation between progressives and moderates prevents the country from advancing, although perhaps the Liberal Union, with its centrist policies, could stabilize the country.\n\nA gradual, constant, and well-executed reconstruction process could give the country a fighting chance in this era of industrialization and power projection. For this to be possible, we must preserve governmental stability above all else and choose our political and financial movements carefully.\n\nThe future is uncertain for the Kingdom of Spain, and with every opportunity comes a threat. We will have to be careful, as a false step could mean the final stumble into a spiral of misfortune for the nation."

Initially a monarchy, it quickly transitioned to a republic, then a military dictatorship, and finally it returned to being a republic in 1846, but is now already teetering on its next political crisis.\n\nSince independence Mexico has been embroiled in 3 wars, first with its former overlord Spain for its continued independence, then with France who sought to extort money from the new nation, and lastly with its northernmost neighbor the United States, who sought to conquer its northern third. It was this last war which would affect the Mexican nation the most, losing said northern third and causing a liberal coup, which the conservatives have actively opposed.\n\nWill the 2nd Mexican Republic manage to quell its inner demons, or will it collapse into a bloody civil war?"
  MEX_1857_Leader_desc: "Ignacio Gregorio Comonfort de los Ríos is a man of his time and place, a shining symbol of Mexican political dogma in the heat of the 19th century. Born as a son of a lieutenant colonel, Ignacio’s life was one of studies and turmoil, forged in the fires of revolution and unrest that gripped the country. Proving himself a military man just like his father, he served through many of the deciding battles that made up the Siege of Mexico City as a cavalry captain, eventually rising to the position of Military Commander of Izúcar de Matamoros. After this, he entered the political battlefield, which proved just as brutal as the wars. His liberal ideals and high military standing made him a leader in the plot that ultimately overthrew the dictatorship of Santa Anna in 1855, and served as the Minister of War for President Juan Alvarez before ascending to the presidency himself in December. Now it falls to him to draft a constitution for his fractured nation, although many feel his liberal views might widen the cracks and bring yet another decade of unrest for the Mexican people."

The 1830s and 1840s witnessed the birth of large-scale liberal and national movements, gaining momentum during the European Revolutions of 1848-49. The Danish monarchy's victory over the German revolutionaries in the Three Years' War led to the rise of the National Liberal Party and the introduction of free trade. The first Danish railways were constructed in the 1850s and the network is continuing to grow expansively across the country.\n\nWill the Kingdom of Denmark be able to resist foreign threats and consolidate its power or will the 19th century mark the end of Denmark as a significant European power?"

  SWE_1857_Leader_desc: "Claës Efraim Günther believes in the code of law, and his life has been led as a man who champions justice, from his polished shoes to the top of his head. Born to a noble family in Örebro, Günther used his skills in philosophy to become a notary at the Court of Appeals, and his career took off quickly from there. In 1828 he joined the Riksdag of the Estates, and over the course of his long career in politics, became an ardent reformer of the penal codes of Sweden, and became one of only a few men in the House of Nobility to appeal towards the rights of inheritance being applied to men and women equally. In 1848, responding to unrest in Stockholm, Günther was appointed minister of the Council of State by King Oscar I. After resigning in 1851, he served as a justice in the Supreme Court, but the Council called him back, this time as Prime Minister of Justice. A rare statesman who does not relish in personal glory or title-hunting, the country’s judges know they have a fair and equal hand balancing the scales in Sweden."

Under his rule, the kingdom banned slave raids in the Sudan, established Egypt’s first bank, and signed the concession for the creation of a great canal at the Suez. With all of this action, Pasha lives a life not far from the style of a French nobleman, an electric, humorous, life-loving man who welcomes foreigners and entertainers into his inner circle, throwing lavish parties, and - most shockingly - a Muslim with a fine taste for wine. The court of Muhammad Sa'id Pasha grows, and so too does his independence from the fealty he pledges to the Ottoman sultan. An Egyptian renaissance man, indeed."

Under Ali's reign, Egypt had underwent sweeping societal and military reforms, and its economy subsequently prospered as cotton cultivation expanded along the banks of the fertile Nile Delta. Egyptian power grew so great that by the late 1830s, Ali saw himself hegemon over the Sudan and even Syria. Britain, alarmed by the sudden upset in the balance of power in the Middle East, launched a military intervention in 1841 that resulted in the return of Syria to Ottoman rule and nominal vassalhood to the upstart Khedivate. Despite this setback and Ali's death in 1849, Egypt has retained its position as a strong, essentially independent regional power in Africa. However, it remains to be seen whether its control of the strategic Nile River, connecting the great European powers to their colonies in Asia, will be its greatest asset or its worst liability..."

Not a man in the Sokoto Caliphate would dare believe the son of a concubine in the court of the Sultan Muhammad Bello would rise to such high standing. Ali was favored over several direct members of the royal line for the throne, and he ascended to the position in November 1842. A strong man for a difficult time, Ali helped to consolidate power in his empire, and cooled tensions with rival emirs throughout his lands. For years, the Caliphate grappled with violence on their border with the Bornu Empire, but they too were swayed to peace by Bello's political sway. Perhaps it was this impressive tact that impressed the British envoy Heinrich Barth in 1853, which opened the Caliphate to trade with the British Empire. When the maps of the continent are drawn, Bello will have played a key role in shaping Africa, and his reign has brought stability to the kingdom that may never be seen again."

This Islamic state is administered by a loose confederation of appointed emirs who pay obeisance to the Sultan in the capital of Sokoto, and the peoples brought under its banner are forced to accept Sharia law or pay dearly.

Europe is still reeling from the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, which ended the previous year with a decisive victory for Prussia and its allies. The German states have united under the leadership of Prussia, and France is struggling to recover from its humiliating defeat. In the aftermath of the war, Prussia has emerged as the dominant power in Europe, and its Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, is a master of realpolitik, seeking to maintain the balance of power and expand German influence overseas.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions are rising between the great powers of Europe. Britain, still the world's preeminent naval power, is seeking to protect its global empire and maintain its influence on the continent. Russia, eager to expand its influence in the Balkans and the Middle East, is looking to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean. Austria-Hungary, weakened by its defeat in the recent war, is struggling to maintain its unity and control over its diverse population.\n\nIn the United States, Reconstruction is underway following the end of the Civil War. The country is still divided over issues of race and equality, and new challenges are emerging as industrial growth and westward expansion create new opportunities and tensions. The government is grappling with how to rebuild the South, ensure the rights of newly freed slaves, and manage relations with Native American tribes.\n\nAround the world, new technologies and innovations are transforming the way people live and work. The telegraph and steam-powered transport are connecting the world in ways never before imagined, and new inventions like the telephone and light bulb are poised to revolutionize society. The future is uncertain, and the leaders of each nation must navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead to secure their place in the world."

The shogunate's isolationist strategy was challenged in the nineteenth century by Russia, Britain, and the United States, making Japanese feudal elites aware of Japan's susceptibility to superior Western weaponry. Following Commodore Matthew Perry's visit, Japan was obliged to sign a series of unequal treaties that, like China, granted Western powers unique advantages in Japan. Young samurai from feudal lands that had been traditionally antagonistic to the Tokugawa system rose up against the government in retaliation. They declared the Emperor's return to power in January 1868, and the final Tokugawa soldiers surrendered in May 1869, after much intense battle. The revolutionaries have urged the Emperor to issue the Charter Oath, which promises a break between the feudal class restrictions of the past and a search for knowledge that could transform Japan into a modernized, thriving country, featuring a bolstered economy and a Western army. The Restoration ushered in the Meiji Period, a time of rapid modernization and Westernization."

  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1912_NAME: "§RWork in Progress:§! Powder Keg of Europe"
  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1912_DESC: "The age of steam and machines has brought about an age of scientific advancements, and a new understanding of the world, establishing Europe as the undisputed ruler of all corners of the globe. Wars of colonization are raging across the world, as nations fight for more lands to carve out their empires.\n\nGermany, an economic and military powerhouse ruled by Kaiser Wilhelm, an ambitious autocrat who seeks to expand Germany's influence, particularly to rival France and the UK, continues to establish itself as the dominant power in Europe, and the world. Their rivals, concerned with the rising nation's worrying ambitions, are allied in hopes of containing Germany's influence.\n\nAs an empire rises, another crumbles. Russia, once a dominant power in Europe and Asia, is still recovering from its humiliating defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. A traditionalist nation that is hesitant to embrace many of the social reforms of the West, such as democracy, republicanism, or parliamentarianism, its government has become divided between many factions vying with each other to gain power. It seems that Russia is a ticking bomb that is bound to explode anytime now.\n\nJapan has rapidly industrialized and is beginning to catch up to the powers of the West, seeking to become a world power equal to its European counterparts by establishing a sphere of influence in East Asia and slowly transforming into a warmongering society, attempting to free Asia from being under the boot of European colonial powers.\n\nWhatever the future holds, it remains to be seen what will happen as the balance of power shifts for better, or for worse."

  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1924_DESC: "As the world recovers from the chaos and destruction of the Great War, the balance of power among the world's great empires is fragile. A war-torn world is ravaged by economic turmoil and social strife as the great powers of the past begin to collapse. The age of industry has given way to a time of change as people demand change and justice against the old cruel and greedy system, forcing all nations around the world to push more and more reforms.\n\nGermany and Austria were among those most affected by the war, and were forced to pay incredible amounts of money for their actions, bringing their economies into turmoil. The people, becoming sick of the restrictions placed on them by other countries, have begun adopting a strong sense of nationalism as their hatred grows toward others with an even more radical mindset than ever before.\n\nThe United States, despite its supposed economic boom, is itself torn from within. Social conflicts and political clashes have sparked a violent divide between the people and the government. America finds itself at the precipice of the future, and its choices now will be the ones with the greatest consequences. Its southern neighbors in Latin America, in their turn, are a different story, plagued with authoritarian dictatorships threatening to disrupt peace in the region and secure their own nation's interests.\n\nThough the chaos of the past still lingers, the world has an opportunity to make a brighter future. Hope is not lost."

  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1933_DESC: "The Great War tore the world apart, and all countries are still reeling from the consequences. A world of economic depression and civil unrest is slowly emerging beneath the surface as a greater threat to humanity.\n\nThe situation in the US is dire due to the Great Depression, which has caused widespread suffering and hardship for millions of people. Food, fuel, and housing are scarce, and many people are without work and hope. It is a crisis of unprecedented magnitude and its effects will be felt for years to come.\n\nItaly and Germany are both suffering from economic depression, political instability, and civil unrest. In Italy, Benito Mussolini has taken control, while in Germany, Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party have shaken the balance of power.\n\nBoth dictators have the same goals: to restore their nation's might, get revenge on those who had wronged them, and defeat Communism in the East. The Soviet Union is slowly turning into an industrial superpower, while the Russian giant is waking up and looking to obliterate anything in its way.\n\nGreat Britain and France, despite standing victorious 15 years ago, have also been damaged by the conflict, having to deal with the aftereffects of destruction as well as an economic crash. Struggling to put themselves back together and still reeling from the loss of so many lives, can they keep peace intact when they can barely keep themselves up?\n\nFactions and groups are vying for power, but there are also those fighting to preserve and protect what is left, and contribute to its restoration."

  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1946_DESC: "For the longest time before, it was evident that the ideologies of America and the Soviet Union were irreconcilable. Now, a line has been drawn across Europe in the form of an iron curtain, dividing East from West. America has developed nuclear weapons and its willingness to use them, and the Soviet Union is not far behind them with its own arsenal. In the Far East, China is in the grip of its own Red Menace, threatening to overtake the country in its civil war. \n\nIn Africa, the empires of old begin to crack, crumble, and disintegrate under the weight of the new order of the day, an order of wars through proxies and through finance. \n\nThe only thing that is certain, is that for the forseeable future the people of the world will be living in the shadow of the bomb."

  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1962_DESC: "At the high noon of the Cold War, two cowboys stepped onto main street to face each other. The product of a decade and a half of paranoia, treachery, and nuclear brinkmanship, finally coming to the edge of confrontation. \n\nIn the Soviet Union, the Kremlin and the people come to terms with who Stalin actually was, now they can do so without the NKVD breathing down their necks. Without the fist of Stalin looming, the people push their boundaries. The Hungarian Uprising is crushed by Soviet tanks, and the erection of the Berlin Wall turns the iron curtain from a metaphorical barrier into a very physical one. Even as Yuri Gagarin completes the first manned orbit of Earth, it seems that liberty from the force of gravity itself is sought as the Russian bear claws at the confines of the planet. \n\nIn the United States, the people wrestle with their own social changes, as the cries for civil rights become too loud to ignore forever. Debates become televised, as Kennedy and Nixon wrestle for the soul of America in the nation's living rooms. Suddenly, across the world, wars and politics have an audience of millions allowing thoughts like Domino Theory and fears of armageddon to spread like wildfire. \n\nThe stage for the crisis is set. \n\nThe stage is Cuba."
