 POLITICS_RAMON_MARIA_NARVAEZ_DESC: "Ramón María Narváez earned the title of 'The Big Sword of Loja' for a reason. The son of a count, Ramón entered the army when he was still a young man, and he carried the conservative ideologies with him to war in Catalonia in 1822. He swore himself to serve Isabel II after the death of King Ferdinand VII in 1833, and went on to win a great number of crucial victories for the crown, eventually becoming general-captain of Old Castille. After years of political intrigue, Narváez was named Prime Minister in July of 1844, but an unstable period of back and forth followed. The Big Sword has been Prime Minister several times over the last few years, and now serves his monarch with an iron fist. He is a brutal, pragmatic beast of a leader, a military man who found himself in the crucible of war, too reactionary to truly serve his country well in the ideas of statecraft. It will perhaps only be in war itself that Narváez finds himself as a head of state."

Raised in one of the most progressive courts in the world, and came into the Sultanate with one of the most difficult crises of the day in his lap, with the war in Egypt slowly running out of steam. He resourcefully ensured peace on favorable terms, and dove into his role with incredible zeal. Using notes left by his father, Abdulmecid introduced the first paper currency, reorganized the army with revolutionary new conscription laws, and revitalized the country with reforms of the financial systems, the courts system and civil codes, and creation of a Ministry for Education. All struggles within his nation he has been able to tackle without much concern, but the empire as a whole is a vibrant one. Strain is showing, though, as Muslim power brokers in his court have chafed at the idea of so much leeway given to non-Muslim subjects. It is one crisis after another for the innovative sultan, and if we have any indication, history tells us he will be up to the task."

 britishindia.17.t: "The State Of The Company"
 britishindia.17.d: "The British East India company was founded on December 31st, 1600, as a joint-stock company with the goal of destroying Spanish and Portuguese monopolies on the Indian Ocean Trade. The Company soon eclipsed the Dutch and Portuguese, along with the French after the Seven Years’ War, were they established a monopoly over colonialism in Asia, as well as trade in Asia. Indian opium, tea, silk, and saltpetre gave the company a reliable, convenient, and plentiful source of income. Although everything seemed to be going swimmingly, the situation within the Raj was reaching a boiling point. The British East India Company had been exploiting ethnic, religious, and tribal differences in order to attain control over the subcontinent. The Company had also enacted many unpopular western reforms that went against the beliefs of the locals, and new tariffs, along with other trade restrictions enacted by the crown, would cripple the internal economy of the Mughal Empire, reversing the proto-industrialization that was left over from the Mughal Empire, and the rich and prosperous eternal economy. Famines also became a glaring problem within Indian society, with over 60 million dying in famines between the 18th and 20th centuries. Many of these problems, as well as the introduction of cartridges made of pig skin into the army and the burden of British Rule, would result in the Sepoy Rebellion Of 1857 (Indian Mutiny). This is a decisive moment in British History, as the “Jewel Of The British Empire”, could soon fall back into the hands of the natives, or it could also be the start of an age of brutal repression, with an increased effort to assimilate the Indian subcontinent into the British Empire…"

 POLITICS_PEDRO_II_DESC: "Don Pedro the Second has beaten the odds to become the man he is today. Ascending to the throne of the Empire of Brazil in-absentia after his father abandoned the throne, the five-year-old Pedro studied the art of statecraft and politics until 1840, when the General Assembly of Brazil named him of age. Coming to power at the age of 14, Pedro grew into a powerful man and monarch, a tall, strapping, and patient man, and it did not take long for him to permanently change the country he led. Three serious crises cropped up early in his reign, the illegal importation of African slaves, the Praieira revolt in 1848, and the war with the Argentines in 1852. Pedro masterfully took on all three challenges, and resolved them with incredible skill, all-but-stamping his name on the ledger of great men of statecraft on the South American continent. With one of the most stable political climates in the world, Brazil has the 31-year-old  Pedro II to thank for their incredible country, which can now be counted alongside some of the greatest nations on Earth."
