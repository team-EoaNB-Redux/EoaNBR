sardinia.1.d: "This mod gives you the option to play with Italian names for victory-points within Italian territories. Do you want to enable this? For immersion purposes, enabling the regional is highly encouraged! If enabled, all VP’s will appear under their regional dialect denominations, with further decisions upon unification to standardize the Italian language across the peninsula, in part, changing the names of cities. You should be warned that these “dialects” for most of history have been considered languages of their own, and in some instances can vastly differ from their modern designations."

sardinia.2.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont"
sardinia.2.d: "§G[PIE.GetNameWithFlag]§! has, since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, has prospered. The Crimean War has placed us in a rather unique position. The §t[ENG.GetNameWithFlag]§! and the §3[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! are now more willing to talk and do business with us then ever before. However, one question burns deep in the heart of Italy.\n\nAnd that is of a unified state, a §GReso§!§grgim§!§Rento!§! of sorts. While this idea burns brightly in the hearts and minds of our countrymen far and wide throughout Italy, the practicality of such a feat is not workable at the moment. We would need to seek a strong and willing ally, which we luckily see in Napoleon III of §3[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! as he has shown signs that he is willing to help our cause...for compensation. The issue now is when and how to start the fire, as once it starts.\n\n\t§RIt becomes very hard to control§!."
sardinia.2.a: "Learn more"
sardinia.2.b: "No, thank you"
sardinia.3.t: "The Revolutions of 1848 in Italy"
sardinia.3.d: "Roughly 9 years ago, Revolution swept Europe. Within two years, every nation was affected. Those whom made it out intact became republics or constituional monarchies. Italy however, was perminantly affected. §G[PIE.GetNameWithFlag]§! under Ferdinand II paved the way for Liberal reforms and constitutionalism throughout Italy. §R[TUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!, §S[PAP.GetNameWithFlag]§! and §G[PIE.GetNameWithFlag]§! reformed into modern systems of government.\n\nWhile some saw it as the Old Guard giving way, many more saw it as another way for them to hold on to their fading power. One did not have to look far to see it in Italy. \n\nThe garrisons along the borders of Lombardy-Venetia controlled by §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! were being reinforced, leading to opposition leaders in Venice and Milan being arrested or simply vanishing. Not long after, waves of anarchy and radicalism swept across the §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!. The people of Venice and Milan wasted no time and deposed their Austrian overlords. By weeks end the §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! Army of Italy was in full retreat back to Austria itself, with nearly all of Lombardy-Venetia in the control of the revolutionaries."
sardinia.3.a: "Tell me more..."
sardinia.4.t: "The Consequence of 1848 "
sardinia.4.d: "While the campaign begun with victory after victory, reality came bearing down as the §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! Army of Italy returned to their Italian Stations en masse. With the Defeat at Custoza and the signing of a humiliating armistice.\nPeace talks began shortly after, with the defeat of the campaign of liberation against §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! rule in Italy, it gridlocked the Italian states into the current borders. Most importantly for our kingdom, was that the former king. His Majesty King Charles Albert, signed and established our young Constitutional Monarchy during this time.\nThe leading question, is if this young system can weather the storm that Italy now finds herself in.\n\n §RAnd if she can get out of it alive...§!"
sardinia.4.a: "That brings us to now..."
sardinia.5.t: "Rally against the Austrians"
sardinia.5.d: "§G[PIE.GetNameWithFlag]§! remains as one of the last truely independent Italian states, standing defiantly against Habsburg influence. §P[NSC.GetNameWithFlag]§! recently married into the §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!, Venezia which was awarded to the Austrians after the Congress of Vienna, along with the central Italian states are under the §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! protection, continues to add fuel to the fire of Italian liberation.\n\nOur people continue to hold an unwaverable spirit for goals of liberation to be achieved, and that our King and the young government can lead the way forward, with each person vowing to fulfill the dreams of a united Kingdom of Italy. As we stand as the last true bastion between §O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! and §3[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! spheres. If we play our cards right, perhaps we can tumble the Austrian tower of cards?\n\n§ROnly time will tell of this matter.§!"
sardinia.5.a: "Let's make it count, or die trying."
sardinia.6.t: "The Protectorate of Monaco"
sardinia.6.d: "The Congress of Vienna had transferred the protection of Monaco from §3[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! to §G[PIE.GetNameWithFlag]§! via the Treaty of Stupinigi, as well as full dominion over the state. The treaty states, “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon in negotiations despite an uneven relationship between our king and the King of Monaco. With the people, we are feared, as we have sent many garrisons to destabilize and annex parts of the Principality."
sardinia.6.a: "More things to handle..."

sardinia.7.t: "Reconstruction of Prismates in Alessandria"
sardinia.7.d: "Alessandria has long been a victim to the floods of the Tanaro. Luckily, the parliament of Sardinia-Piedmont took note of the damage caused by the floods and passed a bill to reconstruct \"prismates\" to protect the fortifications of Alessandria against the floods of the Tanaro. The new bolstered defenses will afford us the ability to build safer in the city and provide security to those who had been effected."
sardinia.7.a: "Alessandria is safer now"

sardinia.8.d: "Today King Victor Emmanuel announced the official closing of the fifth legislature of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. The legislature lasted three years, ten months, and seven days, holding three sessions per article 9 of the Albertine Statute. Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, proceeded over the entirety of this Legislature. The elections for the VI legislature will begin soon as our legislative bodies prepare to undertake the steps necessary to get the Risorgimento underway."

sardinia.9.t: "The Turin Exhibition"
sardinia.9.d: "Following an unsuccessful exhibition in Turin in 1850, it was decided that another exhibition should be held in Turin in 1858. The innovations present in the exhibitions and fairs in Paris and London give much prestige to the minds of those respective nations. The Turin Exhibition included many public industrial representatives, showing off work done by Cavour over the last decade to increase the industrial capabilities of Piedmont. However, despite the impressive changes since 1858, it is still evident that Italy is struggling to implement innovations already present in Europe into the industrial sector. King Victor Emmanuel and Cavour were seen together during the exhibition."

###################################

sardinia.10.t: "Diplomacy with the British"
sardinia.10.d: "Diplomacy with the British rests largely in the friendship of Camillo Benso and the British Legation in Turin - James Hudson. James Hudson himself is quite the italophile, and his position in Turin - held since the days before Benso was prime minister - has convinced him of the need of support for the unification movement. Though he faces some ridicule at home for his position as a favorable ally of Camillo Benso, he will be a key instrument for Sardinia in the attempts to get British support for Unification."
sardinia.10.a: "Tell Hudson that Cavour needs to see him"
sardinia.11.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia"
sardinia.11.d: "James Hudson - the British Legation to Sardinia-Piedmont - has an equal number of allies in enemies in the British Government. The Queen herself is rumored to claim he is too much a friend of the Italians than the British, but nobody in the government will tell you that he is a bad diplomat. Despite his friendship with Cavour and support for Italian unification, Hudson has always kept British interests in mind. Now that the Sardinians are looking for allies in their hopes for Unification communication between our nations is at an all time high. \n The most pressing matter for the Sardinians currently in which they hope to see our position in the case of the Cagliari - a Piedmontese mailing ship with two Brits in the crew which was captured by the neapolitans. The Case is meant to go to parliament where Sardinian officials will make their plea and the fate of British and Sardinian relations will be decided. The date of the session is set for mid-1858."
sardinia.11.a: "Now we wait"
sardinia.12.t: "The Cagliari Case"
sardinia.12.d: "Despite the good relation shared between Cavour and James Hudson, much of the future of the British stake in the peninsula will come down to the Cagliari Case. The Cagliari ship was a Piedmontese Mailing ship captured by the Neapolitans following the failed Sapri Expedition. The British are interested because the crew contained two Brits. The British parliament has agreed to hear the case during the Spring of 1858. It will be here that Sardinian officials will finally be able to plead their case directly to the British Government. Hudson has put in his best words for our cause, but the outcome of this arrangement will be uncertain until it is over."

sardinia.13.t: "The Cagliari Case"
sardinia.13.d: "The Cagliari Case has reached parliament and now we wait to see how the British will rule on this matter. Camillo Benso and a few other Sardinian officials have given testimony in this case, though some sources say they have been rather arrogant about it. Nonetheless this case could prove as an important stepping stone in relations with Britain."
sardinia.13.a: "How do they rule?"
sardinia.14.t: "The Cagliari Case"
sardinia.14.d: "The Cagliari Case - the case of the Sardinian ship with a crew that included a few Brits being captured by Naples - has finally reached Parliament. Though most members of Parliament are skeptical that a ruling further than a denouncement of the actions of the Neapolitans is a smart move, James Hudson has managed to convince many that an alliance with the Sardinian state would be smart and beneficial. The arrogance of the Count of Cavour in this case is not helping his position."
sardinia.14.a: "Withdraw the case, denounce the capture of Brits"
sardinia.14.b: "Side with Piedmont"
sardinia.15.t: "England Withdraws the Case!"
sardinia.15.d: "The British Parliament has withdrawn the Cagliari Case and has not made any statement in our support. Out of fears that a war would come out of this case, many of the Earls spoke against siding with our government. Despite some strong calls in our favor, and the argument that the British have an obligation to uphold Maritime Law, they remain unconvinced."
sardinia.15.a: "Disappointing"
sardinia.24.t: "The British Side with us!"
sardinia.24.d: "In a surprising turn of events the British parliament has declared that it supports the efforts of Sardinia-Piedmont in demanding the release of the Cagliari, and have promised to uphold Maritime Law. This ruling comes even after skepticism from many of the Earls, but thanks to the efforts of Hudson and our other allies in parliament. This will allow us to open up further cooperation between our governments."
sardinia.24.a: "To a Strong Maritime Alliance!"

two_sicilies.11.t: "The Cagliari Case"
two_sicilies.11.d: "Though not an original fear of our government, the capture of the Cagliari - a Sardinian ship captured in early 1857 which happened to have a crew that contained a few Brits - has caused the British Parliament to denounce our actions and side with Piedmont in their threats. The harbormasters are intent on keeping the Cagliari under condemnation, despite these new threats. We are at a dangerous position."
two_sicilies.11.a: "These threats are baseless"
two_sicilies.11.b: "Get the legislature to send an apology, and release the ship"

sardinia_news.1.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Defeats Austria!"
sardinia_news.1.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies have defeated Austria and their puppet Kingdom in Lombardy-Venetia. Just a decade ago the forces of Sardinia-Piedmont were defeated as they invaded Lombardy and many assumed the liberal goals of the Revolutions in 1848 had failed. After the Crimean War, Sardinia-Piedmont took their claims of Italian Unification to the peace talks. Now, the possibility of a unified Italian state is more real than ever. Not only has Austria's influence in the Italian Peninsula been weakened, but the Central Autocratic states have seen revolutions by popular movements hoping to see a unified Italian state."

sardinia_news.19.d: "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco had been made a protectorate of Sardinia-Piedmont. The treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was seen to be detrimental to the economy of Monaco and caused many citizens to lose trust in Prince Charles III. Ever since the Revolutions of 1848, Sardinia-Piedmont has been occupying Menton and Rocabrüna, two regions that declared unification with Sardinia-Piedmont. Now the rest of Monaco has been formerly annexed into the Sardinia-Piedmont. Many question if this was the will of the people of Monaco or the will of politicians in Turin."

sardinia_news.21.t: "The Failure of the Pisacane Expedition"
sardinia_news.21.d: "Carlo Pisacane, along with his band of Sicilian political prisoners and petty theives, has parished following his attempted expedition into Sapri in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Pisacane was though to have been working with Mazzinian circles to attempt to invoke an insurrection against the Bourbon monarchy in the Two Sicilies. The local peasants had been warned ahead of time of the expedition and were told that the members were raiders looking to pillage the local towns. Thanks to the propaganda from the Bourbon authorities, Pisacane and his band were immediately attached by the locals. Despite being able to flee the initial attack, Pisacane and his remaining band were brutally slaughtered by local militia and peasants just days later, with some reports even claiming that cannabilism and other wicked activities were done to members of the expedition.\nFollowing the expedition, pro-Mazzini riots broke out in Genoa and Florence before supporters were arrested. In Piedmont, supporters of the plot are rumored to be facing charges that could lead to their exile to England."

sardinia.211.t: "Annecy-Geneva Railroad"
sardinia.211.d: "Negotiated in part by private companies and the respective parliaments of our nations, it has been determined that a railroad between Annecy and Geneva would benefit the Swiss and Savoy people greatly. Annecy is a hub for current trade between Switzerland and Sardinia-Piedmont, and so serves an important role in the economies of both cities. "
sardinia.211.a: "A Worthwhile investment"
sardinia.215.t: "Border Infrastructure Investments"
sardinia.215.d: "The Sardinia-Piedmont parliament has suggested that infrastructure in the bordering areas of our nations be upgraded. National roads near the border are significantly lacking in proper maintenance and with increased traffic between our nations, whether that be trade or movement of people, an upgrade is likely in order. A joint Swiss-Sardinian project could make quick work to upgrade the existing roads."
sardinia.215.a: "A smart investment"

### United Kingdom  ###

sardinia.236.t: "Postal Convention with England"
sardinia.236.d: "The Parliament has recently negotiated a new postal convention with the English. This will help international mail travel much quicker and with less hoops to jump through. Part of the agreement details increased communication between our two nations and the creation of mail lines supported by steam ships."
sardinia.236.a: "Give me some paper, I'm going to send a letter to the queen!"
sardinia.238.t: "Signal Law with England"
sardinia.238.d: "A new law has been signed with the English regarding the construction of signals for dangerous parts of the Italian coasts. As naval cooperation and trade between our nations has increased, so have accidents and incidents that could have been avoided."
sardinia.238.a: "The seas will be much safer now"

### modena  ###

sardinia.240.d: "Our Parliament recently negotiated a new postal convention in cooperation with the Duchy of Modena. This new accord is expected to improve the promptness of the flow of international mail between our two states due to the removal of prior inflated bureaucracy regarding the traversal of merchandise. The agreement in-part details extended cooperation in the fields of communication and the creation of mail lines supported by steam ships along with vestigial land routes."

sardinia.216.a: "The benefit of good diplomacy"

### United States ###
sardinia.212.t: "U.S. Consular Relations Report"
sardinia.212.d: "As of yet, the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and the United States of America have been generally cordial. Since the initial act of Mutual recognition in 1802 through U.S. Consular Agent François de Navoni, cooperation between our two states has vastly expanded. On February 7, 1839, the United states accepted the credentials of Count Augusto Avogadro de Collobiano as the first charge d'affaires in Washington from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, one year later, the United States established a legation in Turin with the first U.S. charge d'affaires presenting his credentials on September 15, 1840. U.S. involvement in the evacuation of Italian Patriots during the wars of 1848 still lingers in the memories of many Sardinian citizens, as well as the minds of the Austrian authorities. The United States, being a fervent defender of self determination and democracy, very well favors our nation. Although, it has become apparent that any direct support from the United States is unlikely, as internal strife and the ideals of manifest destiny gripe the increasingly divided young nation."
sardinia.212.a: "Review Sardinian-American Commercial Relations."
sardinia.213.t: "Commercial Assessment"
sardinia.213.d: "The United States has, as of recently, grown to become a vital and lucrative partner in commerce for our kingdom. Since signing a universally amiable treaty of trade and commerce on November 16, 1838 when U.S. delegates met with King Carlo Alberto, Emanuele II’s father, our two states have enjoyed a pleasant and increasingly advantageous relationship. Shipments of cotton depart the southern states for Sardinian textile manufacturers, where the material plays a pivotal role as a prime material in the production of Piedmontese textile products. Similarly to other northern italian textiles, the textiles from our manufacturers themselves are held amongst the highest regard in the consumerist economies of the northern states. The periodical increase in demand for raw materials, especially cotton due to our ever-expanding industries over the past couple of decades has left Sardinia-Piedmont in a state of near dependency on the lucrative cotton trade with the United States."
sardinia.213.a: "Intriguing..."
sardinia.214.t: "Strategic Assessment"
sardinia.214.d: "In June of 1848, Carlo Alberto granted the U.S. docking privileges in the port town of La Spezia after intense negotiations. The United States greatly values this arrangement, seeing the continuity of its usage as a U.S. docking bay and refueling station within the Mediterranean Sea as of utmost strategic importance. Many conservative politicians in parliament see the agreement as a breach of Sardinia-Piedmont’s national security, citing that in addition to the arrangement displaying subordination, the United States may use its preemptive advantage against us in the case of future conflict between our two states, and advocate for its immediate repeal. While it is universally understood that the United States would be understanding of our rapid change in policy, and retaliation is not a concern, withdrawing such a concession would surely strain relations with the United States, a nation widely considered to be a close confrère of our kingdom."
sardinia.214.a: "This is a direct breach in our national security! Repeal U.S. docking permissions immediately!"
sardinia.214.b: "We have enough enemies as is, best not to cause trouble where it isn’t due."

### Denmark
sardinia.234.t: "Sound Toll Payments"
sardinia.234.d: "As part of the Copenhagen Convention, which granted free passage to European shipping companies through the Sound Dunes, we are expected to pay a portion of the fees. Though costly, the agreement will make merchant deals between our nations much easier."

sardinia.232.t: "State of the Economy"
sardinia.232.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way since Camillo Benso di Cavour’s appointment in 1850. Cavour immediately began work on constructing a modern economy for the nation- Closing excessive monasteries, reducing the amount of benefices, and correcting the nation's lopsided spending deficit. In order to finance major public works projects and extensive industrial expansion, as well as to pay off war indemnities to Austria acquired after the war of 1848, Cavour masterfully floated vast internal and international loans, particularly from France and the United Kingdom. The subsequent subsidization of private railway companies and Sardinia-Piedmont diverse artisan-based Industrial sectors has led to the nation’s rise to becoming the most advanced and modern state within the Italian peninsula."
sardinia.232.a: "We must continue to strengthen the economy"
### RAILWAY EVENTS  ###
sardinia.233.t: "Infrastructural Developments"
sardinia.233.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont began subsidizing broad rail projects in the mid 1840s, connecting many major economic sectors throughout the nation such as Genoa and Turin, which in-turn lowered the cost of the transport of goods and persons, as well as provided a broad array of occupations to support middle class Piedmontese citizens.Cavour’s cabinet has identified connecting Turin to French and Swiss economic centers, such as Geneva and Lyon as of primary economic concern."
sardinia.233.a: "Very well, authorize drafting for the Rail lines"

sardinia.45.t: "Agriculture in Sardinia"
sardinia.45.d: "Agrarianism has constituted the vast majority of the Sardinian economy for as long as many can remember. As the economies of Europe begin to shift towards Industrialization—and Piedmont along with it, the island of Sardinia has been left underdeveloped and to be exploited for resources to fuel mainland Industries. The situation in Sardinia is considered volatile by much of the Piedmontese ruling class, hampering any efforts to change the economic or political makeup of the island any further. The question remains on whether Industrialization efforts should be forwarded to the island, or if it can remain strictly a strategic installment, and be of use in other sectors of our economy."
sardinia.45.a: "Best to not agitate them any further..."
sardinia.45.b: "They will need to learn to get with the times"

sardinia.231.t: "Maritime Assets"
sardinia.231.d: "The urgent exigency for modern steam or other screw-driven vessels to substitute the since antiquated models of the Sardinian fleet has become ever apparent to the Sardinian legislature since Cavour’s inauguration in 1850. Efforts to revitalize the maritime capabilities of Sardinia-Piedmont by the Cavour cabinet have been substantial, with many preeminent warships being added to Sardinia’s minimal array of naval assets. As acting Minister of the Navy, in 1853 Cavour signed a series of accords with the United Kingdom including a variety of orders for vessels to be constructed in the United Kingdom for the Sardinian fleet, including that of four advanced screw-propeller driven steam frigates. Two of these vessels have since been commissioned in the Regia Marina."

sardinia.146.d: "King Victor Emmanuel has long wanted to create a new military code. With war seemingly on the horizon the need for such a law has finally been brought into fruition. The new codification will mandate five years of active service with six years in reserve, up to the age of thirty, with fifty days of obligatory training and instruction per year. Active service will be divided into ordinanza and provinciale. The new code also regulates those who qualify to join the army, leaving criminals or exiles from joining the military."

A friend of both Napoleon III and Cavour, he has brought news that the French are seeking an alliance with our nation against the Austrians in order to finally remove them from the Italian Peninsula and support our cause for unification.

PIE_Russian_French_Deny_TT: "At the first word of an alliance proposal from France diplomat Costantino Nigra was sent to Paris to confirm these rumors. He met with Henri Conneau, Napoleon III's personal physician, and confirmed that there was ample support in the French leadership for further talks for an alliance between our nations. However, Nigra informed Henri of an already existing alliance between Russia and Sardinia-Piedmont which is now cause for concern in the French leadership. While a joint war with Russia and Sardinia against Austria would be enough to demolish the remaining power of Austria, it would be increasingly likely to create a wider European conflict."

The anger from §Y[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! refusal to join the war with russia can play into our hands.\n §t[ENG.GetNameWithFlag]§! shows no interest publicly on the matter, internally via the Foreign office. Their desire for the maintaining of the Balance of power and control of the Mediterranian sea means they can play a powerful ally if we can win them over. However, that option is not possible in a out right war with Austria.\n As for §2[PRS.GetNameWithFlag]§!, they would join the war against §Y[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!. The main concern established by their ministers is that doing so would alienate them from their fellow germanic brothers with their own unification to rival §Y[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!.\n At the end of it all, we can either go with the steady hand of §B[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! or the great Bear called §G[RUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!.\n Whom do we pick?"

##Tuscan Focus Tree
TUS_focus_the_tuscan_economy: "The Tuscan Economy"
TUS_focus_the_tuscan_economy_desc: " If we are to become more than just a state to be dictated by foreign powers, we must develop an economy. Turning our focus here will benefit all of Tuscany."
TUS_focus_the_sharecropping_debates: "The Sharecropping Debate"
TUS_focus_the_sharecropping_debates_desc: "Due to our agrarian economy, it is obvious that sharecropping should be considered, seeing it’s success in the American south with its cotton industry. While a larger harvest would benefit us, this may upset the people as it will most definitely bring more of the poor into debt with landlords. This must be decided before we go any further with agriculture. "
TUS_focus_textile_industry: "The Textile Industry"
TUS_focus_textile_industry_desc: "The textile industry is something that many have made profits off of, especially in England. We would be foolish to not take advantage of its growth to further boost our economic ambitions."
TUS_focus_the_artisans: "The Artisans"
TUS_focus_the_artisans_desc: "Like much of the Italian peninsula, our economy is dominated by artisan-based industry. With our economy on the way to growing, it is pivotal that we make use of the artisans within our country. Their skill would be much needed in our workforce, and it will help increase our profits from exports with their talents utilized."
TUS_focus_ridolfis_experiment: "Ridolfi's Experiment"
TUS_focus_ridolfis_experiment_desc: "Ridolfi is a man that could bring the reform that Tuscany needs. If wages inspire our workers to work harder, perhaps it would be worth trying this. Productivity is what will keep us thriving, especially with our agrarian economy. However, a significant conflict has erupted between Ridolfi’s supporters and his critics. This may be too expensive, which might mean losing more money than we need to. This must be settled as we work on our agricultural sector."
TUS_focus_reform_elsewhere: "Reform Elsewhere"
TUS_focus_reform_elsewhere_desc: "Despite the promising aspects of Ridolfi's experimentation in the Agricultural sectors, our ministers have never been fond of changes the Tuscan economic outlook. We must look for a different solution, the workers are not the tools we need, though it is becoming clear that the estates might be the ones receiving more power, which will make us more popular with the upper class, the ones with actual power."
TUS_focus_land_reclamation: "Maremma Reclaimations"
TUS_focus_land_reclamation_desc: " Innovation is what we need and with our agrarian economy, it is a doctrine we must utilize to maintain our economy. Making artificial land would give us more land to farm and more land for the estates to control, which can kickstart our agricultural sector above the rest of Italy."
TUS_focus_power_to_the_estates: "Power to the Estates"
TUS_focus_power_to_the_estates_desc: "The estates are what makes us profits, workers may be important but with no estates, there would be no farms for us to profit off of. We must give the necessary power to the estates that allows them to work as efficiently as possible, which would only bring more into our pockets."
TUS_focus_introduce_wage_labour: "Introduce Wage Labor"
TUS_focus_introduce_wage_labour_desc: "According to Ridolfi’s plans, we will introduce wages for workers which will increase our worker’s productivity for a small cost. This will also reduce tensions when it comes to sharecropping, a small price to pay for the stability of our nation."
TUS_focus_curtail_innovation: "Curtail Innovation"
TUS_focus_curtail_innovation_desc: "Why fix what works? Making artificial land does not help us, the productivity of our workers does! The work they do, which has increased due to the wages we have given them, is enough for us to move forward. We must stomp out outrageous ideas of innovation, and stick to what works."
TUS_focus_power_to_the_workers: "Power to the Workers"
TUS_focus_power_to_the_workers_desc: "With the new reforms we have made, worker productivity is at its absolute height! Fields are being worked with a national drive and with much needed stability being brought within our lower-class populace. By giving power to the workers, we are getting more profits along with a more stable agricultural society."
TUS_focus_continue_with_free_trade: "Continue with Free Trade"
TUS_focus_continue_with_free_trade_desc: "The Grand Duke and his government have long been proponents of Free Trade. Exports are something we must utilize if we want to be a shining star in Italian economics. With artisan talents and a workforce with growing skill, we have the methods to create economic interests for other nations to invest in. Not only will our economy grow, but we will gain much needed trade relations as well."
TUS_focus_protect_tuscan_production: "Protect Tuscan Production"
TUS_focus_protect_tuscan_production_desc: "We must keep a firm hold on our products, our resources, and our economic independence. Depending on foreign trade could put us in an economic disaster and trade relations can threaten our isolation. We must stop the excessive exports, so we can put our own resources to our own use, which will be far more reliant than exports."
TUS_focus_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside: "Consumers Exist not in the Countryside"
TUS_focus_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside_desc: "If we are to make a real profit, we must accept the fact that our economy does not depend on our internal powers but more so from foreign buyers, regardless of our plans on trade, it is important that we maintain some level of trade."
TUS_focus_but_outside_the_countryside: "But Outside the Country"
TUS_focus_but_outside_the_countryside_desc: "In the words of a Livorian banker, the Tuscan market is too small compared to what it could be. We must put efforts towards expanding the market if we are to reach our economic peak. We must expand our reach through trade, which will help our economy run along smoothly."
TUS_focus_the_expanding_grain_market: "The Expanding Grain Market"
TUS_focus_the_expanding_grain_market_desc: "Grain has become a valued and more necessary resource that provides an opportunity for us to take advantage of. With increased harvests and our agricultural sector being expanded and improved upon, we can export grain to foreign powers with a guaranteed profit."
TUS_focus_the_iron_industry: "The Iron Industry"
TUS_focus_the_iron_industry_desc: " Iron is a resource that is growing in value which we have. We must dig deep and greedily, as with technology moving forward that utilizes iron, it will be important for us to be a step ahead, which benefits both sides of our trading policies. "
TUS_focus_learn_from_leghorn: "Learn from Leghorn"
TUS_focus_learn_from_leghorn_desc: "If Tuscany is to prosper, then we must learn from the ways of Livorno. The profits that were made from a free port city is something that we Tuscans should take advantage of, and it can benefit our intentions to increase the Tuscan market’s reach to Europeans. Just in the way of Livorno, we shall make our port cities hubs for trading profit."
TUS_focus_modernisation: "Modernization"
TUS_focus_modernisation_desc: "As we push economically, it is vital that we recognize the need for modernization, we must study foreign techniques, to replace our outdated techniques and equipment. This is needed so we can push Tuscany’s capabilities to their limit. "
TUS_focus_not_industrialisation: "Railway Developments"
TUS_focus_not_industrialisation_desc: "The Grand Duke of Tuscany long supported the development of rail in Tuscany. Railways could even be found in Lucca prior to its annexation into Tuscany. Multiple politicians and companies support the expansion of rail networks all around Tuscany to help support the economy."
TUS_focus_social_concerns: "Social Concerns"
TUS_focus_social_concerns_desc: "With the world changing, and Tuscany along with it, our social society has grown reasonably worried. We must address the concerns of the lower and upper class to help maintain our economic stability. Along with this, it can bring much needed trust back into the government from both sides. "
TUS_focus_stability_for_workers: "Stability for Workers"
TUS_focus_stability_for_workers_desc: "While there is debate on the priority of land owners and workers, it is also known that both are vital. We must provide stability for the lower class workers. After-all, without anyone to work the farms, there would be no harvest for us to profit off of. "
TUS_focus_and_for_land_owners: "And for Land Owners"
TUS_focus_and_for_land_owners_desc: "Land owners are a very important factor in our growing agricultural setting, without them, there would be no farms for us to profit off of and there would be no harvest as well. We must provide stability for them as well, as we push Tuscany to a golden age of agricultural modernization and improvement."

# Tuscan Political Tree
TUS_focus_the_political_scene: "The Political Scene"
TUS_focus_the_political_scene_desc: "The Politics of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany are not what they used to be. Power is held almost entirely by the Duke and the nobility. After Austria forced the removal of the constitution, liberal elements of society were pushed underground. However, these movements are still strong and may rise to challenge the Duke or call on him to remember his past support of liberalism."
TUS_focus_memories_of_the_past: "Memories of the Past"
TUS_focus_memories_of_the_past_desc: "The Revolutions of 1848 were a great period in Tuscany. The Grand Duke supported Sardinia's war against Austria and a constitution was enacted. Unfortunately our forces did not find favor in the war and the Austrian Empire demanded the removal of the constitution. These events continue to haunt the Tuscan society."
TUS_focus_de_moderate_liberalism: "Moderate Liberalism"
TUS_focus_de_moderate_liberalism_desc: "Liberalism is not an unfamiliar concept to the Tuscan people. The Grand Duke himself supported liberal elements of the revolutions of 1848. We can work towards liberalizing society and avoiding the eyes of Austria, though a choice must be made if we will entrust that to Radicals or Republicans."
TUS_focus_into_radicalism: "Towards Radicalism"
TUS_focus_into_radicalism_desc: "Radicalism has always been a powerful force within Italy. From the Carbonari in the south to the mazzinian societies of the North. Putting our faith in them again is our only chance to free Tuscany from the autocratic yoke."
TUS_focus_into_republicanism: "Towards Republicanism"
TUS_focus_into_republicanism_desc: "If we are to liberalize Tuscany it must be done with the support of the Grand Duke. The people still have some admiration for the Grand Duke despite the authority he rules with. With Leopold II leading a more liberal Tuscany we will be better situated to challenge Austrian influence and ensure our government's strength."
TUS_focus_strengthen_the_national_society: "Strengthen the National Society"
TUS_focus_strengthen_the_national_society_desc: "The Italian National Societies exist across the peninsula as groups of revolutionaries, radicals, and liberals. Many of the groups contain politicians and spread their words and arms alike around in order to increase support for Italian Unification."
TUS_focus_convince_the_populace: "Convince the Populace"
TUS_focus_convince_the_populace_desc: "If Tuscany is to be liberalized the people must be convinced that we will not fail again. There are various steps we can take to decrease Austrian influence and work towards building that trust."
TUS_focus_revivce_hopes_for_constitutional_monarchy: "Constitutional Monarchy"
TUS_focus_revivce_hopes_for_constitutional_monarchy_desc: "The position of Prime Minister does already exist in the Tuscan government, so transitioning to a proper constitutional monarchy will not be incredibly difficult. "
TUS_focus_revive_the_1848_goals: "Goals of 1848"
TUS_focus_revive_the_1848_goals_desc: "The goals of the revolutions of 1848 never did come to fruition completely. As we move to utilize radical elements of Tuscan politics, those goals will need to be executed."
TUS_focus_prepare_for_revolution: "Prepare for Revolution"
TUS_focus_prepare_for_revolution_desc: "It has been decided. The only way to properly liberalize Tuscany will be through revolution!"
TUS_focus_work_with_outside_forces: "Work with Outside Forces"
TUS_focus_work_with_outside_forces_desc: "There are many outside forces that may wish to see the influence of Austria weakened. While they may not agree with our political ideals, we may be able to gather some support."
TUS_focus_a_message_to_others: "A Message to Others"
TUS_focus_a_message_to_others_desc: "Sardinia-Piedmont is not the only nation seeking to weaken Austria. Though it is unlikely that we will get any direct support, it may be possible to find material support from other nations."
TUS_focus_a_message_to_sardinia: "A Message to Sardinia"
TUS_focus_a_message_to_sardinia_desc: "Sardinia-Piedmont is our natural ally against the Austrians as they proceed with their aspirations to unite Italy. Though there may be disagreements between our two nations on the future of Italy, we can agree to eliminating the Austrian menace from the peninsula."
TUS_focus_the_farmer_rebellion: "The Farmer's Rebellion"
TUS_focus_the_farmer_rebellion_desc: "With the war between Sardinia-Piedmont and Austria nearing, the farmers of Tuscany have prepared to enter into rebellion. Supported by the radical societies and many liberal elements, the people have finally united once again to combat the authoritative rule imposed by the Grand Duke and the Austrian Empire."
TUS_focus_favour_a_party: "Favor a Party"
TUS_focus_favour_a_party_desc: "Grand Duke Leopold still has a lot of influence in the politics of Tuscany, despite his transition to head of state. The next prime minister may not be an ally of the Duke strictly speaking, but giving support to someone with the right ideas will lead Tuscany in the right direction."
TUS_focus_the_republicans: "The Republicans"
TUS_focus_the_republicans_desc: "The Republicans, though not strong supporters of the Duke, were strong supporters of our efforts in the 1848 war against Austria. Running for prime minister is a former member of the Council of Milan, someone well informed in the ideas necessary to liberalize Italy."
TUS_focus_the_conservatives: "The Conservatives"
TUS_focus_the_conservatives_desc: "The Conservatives are much stronger supporters of the Duke and the new constitutional monarchy. Ensuring the election of a conservative prime minister with popular support will create a strong relationship between the new government and Leopold's new position."

TUS_focus_new_pol_era_desc: "In the wake of revolutions and modernization of nations, it is time that Tuscany enters the world stage, putting an end to our prolonged state of neutrality and being fondled by foreign hands, as we make Tuscany known amongst Europe. Enter stage right, Tuscany!"

TUS_focus_return_constitution_desc: "The Tuscanian constitution, brought by Grand Duke Leopold the II must be revived as we independently move into foreign politics, as we bring back the enjoyed liberalism of the regime of 1848! We will not be curbed by the Austrians anymore! La Toscana va avanti!"

TUS_focus_expand_liberties_desc: "With our plans to liberalize our regime without Austrians interfering in our politics, we must bring back the liberties we once had under the old constitution.

TUS_focus_reaction_revolutions: "Reaction to the Revolutions"
TUS_focus_reaction_revolutions_desc: "While Tuscany is no stranger to revolutions, as seen in the incidents in Livorno in the past, it is vital that we state our reaction to these revolutions and our stance on them before we further our expansion on foreign politics as we make ourselves known. It may help align us with other powers, and at the very least, improve our relations."

TUS_focus_land_reform_desc: " Even though we have tried our best to dodge this issue economically, it is clear that some level of reform is needed towards land.

TUS_focus_prepare_unite_italy_desc: " It is time for us to prepare, enough focusing on economics and our politics for now. We must militarize, as we will push for the goal of unification of Italy. We will make this happen, through diplomacy, or by force. We must prepare for both."

# Tuscan Events
tuscany.1.t: "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany"
tuscany.1.d: "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany has long been ruled by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, interrupted only during Napoleon's conquest of Italy. During the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duke Leopold II embraced liberalism and our soldiers fought side by side with those from Sardinia, The Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples. Overthrown by popular revolt still, Leopold could only return to rule Tuscany with the assistance of Austria, whose garrison only left in 1855. With the liberal constitution revoked the politics of the Duchy are stagnant. An incompetent ruling class rules over the land of Tuscany. As Sardinia-Piedmont is beginning to suggest Italian Unity our people become restless. Will the traditions of our Duchy lead us to dust, or will we embrace the republican spirit of our people?"
tuscany.1.a: "It is a trying time"
tuscany.2.t: "The Tuscan Economy"
tuscany.2.d: "The Tuscan Economy is almost entirely agrarian. The largest export from our nation is grain. Despite the agrarian occupation that many of our citizens hold, there is a growing artisan industry as the need for manufacturing increases. Rails in the Duchy are in the midst of an upgrade as work with the Austrian rail companies assists the connections we make between our capital and the port city of Livorno. Livorno is the home of trade and industry for Tuscany. Textiles and Iron flow from the port as the base for our economy. However, a battle is brewing between land owners and peasants, and bosses and workers."
tuscany.2.a: "More Problems to Solve"
tuscany.3.t: "The Sharecropping Debate"
tuscany.3.d: "Feudalism has never really left Tuscany. The Sharecroppers, mezzadros, has a compact with the landowner to cultivate land and share profits from sales in return for housing, seeds, and other minor goods. The merits of this system are being called into question by our politicians, especially the liberal ones. More and more farmers are demanding the rights to own their own land."
tuscany.3.a: "The future of mezzadria is in question"
tuscany.4.t: "The Ridolfi Experiment"
tuscany.4.d: "Cosimo Ridofli operates a fine winery in Tuscany. As the issues with sharecropping influence many land owners, Ridolfi has proposed possibly introducing wage labor on a wider scale in Tuscany. Wage labor is something usually reserved to those who work with the artisans or other part of the economy. There is disagreement if introducing wage labor to agriculture could solve our issues or make them worse."
tuscany.4.a: "We must introduce wage labor"
tuscany.4.b: "Our reforms must be elsewhere"
tuscany.5.t: "The Political Scene"
tuscany.5.d: "Leopold II is not a very popular leader. His dynasty is propped up by Austria and their empire influences our nation a great deal. One condition of his return was the removal of the constitution, something the liberal politicians seek to have returned. There are minor legislative powers in the government but much power is centralised. As rumors that Sardinia-Piedmont will make its attempt to unify Italy soon are spreading, so is discontent and shadow organizations."
tuscany.5.a: "The future is unknown"
tuscany.6.t: "Memories of 1848"
tuscany.6.d: "Following the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duchy of Tuscany joined the Sardinian coalition in the fight against Austria. Our troops eventually pulled out along with those of the Two Sicilies and Papal States, and our people revolted against Duke Leopold II. The Austrian Empire eventually put down the revolt and reinstated Leopold, at the cost of removing the constitution granted after the revolutions. The people do not have fond memories of the events that unfolded."
tuscany.6.a: "An unfortunate legacy"
tuscany.7.t: "Liberalism in Tuscany"
tuscany.7.d: "Though not present today, Tuscany has a long history of liberal elements. It was the original Senate of the Forty-Eight that eventually allowed the Medici family to create the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In Tuscany today liberalism is all but criminalized. Liberal politicians work in secret organizations away from the public eye. With Austrian influence in the nation, many wonder if a radical approach is necessary just as it was in 1848. There are a wealth of secret radical societies and exiled politicians that would be ready to assist a new uprising. On the other hand, if Leopold II came out in support of a constitutional monarchy, it could diminish the chance that Austria attempts to interfere in our nation's politics again."
tuscany.7.a: "Radicalism is our only hope"
tuscany.7.b: "Republicanism is our only chance"
tuscany.8.t: "Tuscan National Society"
tuscany.8.d: "Italian National Societies exist across the peninsula. Most prominent are the societies in Piedmont and Lombardy. Originally founded by the supporters of Mazzini, these societies support the unification of Italy through a variety of means. In Tuscany the national societies have been forced underground. Allowing these societies to return to a more public scene will further support for liberalizing Tuscany."
tuscany.8.a: "The time for change has come"
tuscany.9.t: "An End to the Sharecropping Debate?"
tuscany.9.d: "Drastic changes is the political climate of the nation have reignited debates over the economy of Tuscany. Though the estates and nobles have lost much of their power, sharecropping is not a system that will be removed from Tuscany quickly. Many question if it is time for our nation to finally adopt the Industrial Revolution completely. At the same time, the rest of Europe is removing their farmland and replacing it with factories. Demands for Tuscan grain are higher than ever and clearing land for factories will hamper our ability to meet the needs of nations looking to import our grain. However, a choice must be made."
tuscany.9.a: "Embrace the Industrial Revolution"
tuscany.9.b: "We must ride out our agrarian roots longer"
tuscany.10.t: "The Path to Perugia"
tuscany.10.d: "There has long been plans to expand our rail lines into Perugia. These plans have been proposed from various politicians and companies. Grand Duke Leopold II originally desired to have the line pass through Siena, extending the Florence-Siena line. Bettino Ricaosoli and many other favored extending the Arezzo line. With the completion of both the Siena and Arezzo lines, a decision must be made regarding the path to Perugia."
tuscany.10.a: "The Siena Line"
tuscany.10.b: "The Arezzo Line"
tuscany.11.t: "The Constitutional Monarchy"
tuscany.11.d: "It is no secret that Leopold II harbors some support for the liberal movements within Italy. In a bold move against the Austrian Empire Leopold II has allowed the transition towards a Constitutional Monarchy to begin. Giovanni Baldasseroni, prime minister under Leopold II, has been given a temporary increase in power as the office of the Prime Minister will take over as head of government. Leopold II will remain as head of state and though his political power is certainly weakened, his dynasty has secured a place in Tuscan politics."
tuscany.11.a: "This was a necessary step to take"
tuscany.12.t: "Return of the Constitution"
tuscany.12.d: "It has been a long time now that Tuscany has lacked a proper constitution. After the first constitution was forcibly removed by the Austrian Empire many doubted that such a thing could return to Tuscany. Against all odds, however, our people have triumphed and the Constitution has returned. This time around, Austria will not be able to force her will on us."
tuscany.12.a: "The Freedom of Italians must be protected!"
tuscany.13.t: "Favoring a Party"
tuscany.13.d: "With the Grand Duke's position in the government of Tuscany solidified, the influence of his dynasty cannot be ignored. The first elections for the Prime Minister of Tuscany will occur soon and the victor will not win without the influence of Leopold II."
tuscany.13.a: "Support the Republicans, keep our \"enemies\" close"
tuscany.13.b: "The Conservatives are more in line with our views"
tuscany.14.t: "Elections of 1859"
tuscany.14.d: "Today will go down as one of the most important days in Italian history. Record numbers of people have come out to vote for the prime minister of Tuscany. Grand Duke Leopold II has proceeded over the elections and is preparing to announce the victor. It is no secret that he may have influenced the outcome but it has not taken away from the joy of the people."
tuscany.14.a: "Conservative Ubaldino Peruzzi, last of the Medici's"
tuscany.14.b: "Republican Carlo Cattaneo, former member of the Council of Milan"
tuscany.15.t: "Italian Revolutionaries in Parma and Modena"
tuscany.15.d: "The Duchies of Parma and Modena were forced into the Austro-Sardinian war for the same connections to Austria that once held our nation down. Just like our people refused to fight in favor of Austria, the people of Parma and Modena have formed revolutionary councils with temporary power granted to liberal politicians. These regions are now prepared to join with any cause hoping to unite Italy."
tuscany.15.a: "Convince their leaders to join us"
tuscany.15.b: "Fellow Italians United!"
tuscany.16.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont"
tuscany.16.d: "With our ambitions to unify the peninsula known, the time has come to open diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont. Many in our government hope that an agreement can be reached that will avoid conflict. Sardinia-Piedmont employs an army that may be difficult to defeat, despite the large number of Italians who now support our efforts. If an agreement is to be reached, it will surely be costly."
tuscany.16.a: "[TUS.GetLeader] must meet with [PIE.GetLeader]"
tuscany.16.b: "It is too late for diplomacy"
tuscany.17.t: "Tuscany seeks Diplomacy"
tuscany.17.d: "[TUS.GetLeader] is meeting with [PIE.GetLeader] today to discuss the possibility of unifying our governments. Though an extreme measure, both of our governments have expressed desire to see the Italian Peninsula unified. Unfortunate for our position is the fact that Tuscany has embraced a much more liberalized government and outlook than we employ. The people of Italy have become split and fear of revolutionaries joining Tuscany have become very real. The best offer we can accept is to guarantee that our politicians have solidified positions in the new government."
tuscany.17.a: "We have no choice, secure a position for our politicians"
tuscany.17.b: "We came this far, war it will have to be"
tuscany.18.t: "The Costly Agreement"
tuscany.18.d: "Coming as somewhat of a surprise the government of Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to unite our governments, requiring only that politicians from Turin are given special positions. While the agreement will tarnish our reputation and introduce possible corruption into our government, it is a great leap into building the legitimacy of our nation and claims."
tuscany.18.a: "Unification is Near"
tuscany.19.t: "Hostilities Break Out!"
tuscany.19.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont was unwilling to attempt to unify our governments, even at the suggestion of placing their politicians in key positions. With no agreement in sight, it did not take long for a state of war to be declared. Sardinia-Piedmont claims that our government is illegitimate and violates agreements made following the Second Independence war, while our claim rests upon our representation of all Italians and the greater liberal unification movement."
tuscany.19.a: "War is Among Us"
tuscany.20.t: "Garibaldi Joins our Cause"
tuscany.20.d: "Giuseppe Garibaldi, hero of the Italian People, has arrived to pledge his support for our movement. All too aware of the elitist present in Turin, Gariabldi was eager to join our attempts to create a truly liberalized Italy. The presence of Garibaldi has increased moral among the people greatly and has given us much legitimacy in the eyes of Italians."
tuscany.20.a: "Our Victory is certainly Secured!"
tuscany.21.t: "Supporting Democracy in Tuscany"
tuscany.21.d: "As our influence in the Central States continues to grow, the question has arisen as to how much support we should dedicate to Tuscan democracy. The people of Tuscany are very supportive of liberalization but many radicals persist to challenge our ideal for unification. Some fear that should we strengthen Tuscan democracy too much, their own radical movement may rise to challenge our hopes for unification."
tuscany.21.a: "We cannot risk intervention"
tuscany.21.b: "We must weaken Austria's sphere"
tuscany.22.t: "A Leader for the Movement"
tuscany.22.d: "Many prominent figures have risen to the loose leadership circles of the secret societies and radical groups in Tuscany. As the time is approaching for our movement to rise up against the Duke, a leader must be singled out. Many point to Ricasoli - A prominent liberal politician and someone who could represent the hidden agenda of our revolutionary council without making our members' ideology known. Others call on Niccolò Tommaseo who has been in Tuscany since 1857. Tommaseo held important positions in the Republic of San Marco during the revolutions of 1848 and has held firm against Sardinia-Piedmont becoming a power in Italy."
tuscany.22.a: "Tommaseo shall lead once again"
tuscany.22.b: "The people trust Ricasoli already"
tuscany.23.t: "Revolutionary Spirit"
tuscany.23.d: "There is a certain spirit around Tuscany as of late. The feeling of revolution is in the air as both radicals and liberals join forces in preparing to launch a revolution against the Duke and his oppressive regime. Italians across the peninsula who have been made aware of the plan, through our network of secret societies and operatives, are flocking into Tuscany in order to join in the fight for true liberty in Italy."
tuscany.23.a: "First we liberate Tuscany, then the whole of Italy"
tuscany.24.t: "Subverting Austrian Influence"
tuscany.24.d: "Despite most of their garrisons having left, the Austrian still exert a level of influence over the politics of our nation. The Austrians may be willing to invade once again should our goals be made clear to them too quickly. We must play a dangerous game of politics in order to keep the Austrian eyes away from our activites. As soon as we can convince them to have their garrisons leave the country entirely, we will have more room to expand operations."
tuscany.24.a: "They must think nothing is amiss..."
tuscany.25.t: "Tuscan Radicals Request Arms"
tuscany.25.d: "The Radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with arms. It is no secret that we would benefit from a weaker Austrian sphere of influence in Italy and supporting the Tuscan movement to break away from the Pro-Austrian Duke Leopold II would help to weaken the Austrian grip on the Italian peninsula."
tuscany.25.a: "Supply them with Arms"
tuscany.25.b: "We cannot support them"
tuscany.28.t: "[FROM.GetDef] Declines Assistance"
tuscany.28.d: "Our request for assistance has been decline by [FROM.GetDef]. Perhaps they were unwilling to risk any diplomatic issues that could have arisen or maybe they just didn't care to support our movement. Hopefully we can make do without their help."
tuscany.28.a: "Unfortunate"
tuscany.29.t: "The French Accept our Request!"
tuscany.29.d: "The French have accepted our request for arms. Their government is just as eager as we are to see Austrian influence in the Italian peninsula weakened. There is no doubt they may have other motives for supporting us but we cannot be concerned with those now. These arms will help our fight."
tuscany.29.a: "Merci France!"
tuscany.26.t: "Tuscan Radicals request Goods"
tuscany.26.d: "The radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with goods. It is no secret that after their betrayal in the Crimean War we have not had strong relations with the Austrians. It may be time to have the Austrians weakened in their sphere of influence."
tuscany.26.a: "Supply them with Goods"
tuscany.26.b: "We cannot support them"
tuscany.30.t: "The Russians Accept our Request"
tuscany.30.d: "Though somewhat surprising, the Russians have agreed to supply us with some goods in order to assist in our fight against Austria and her puppet government in Tuscany. The Austrian Empire betrayed Russia in the Crimean War and it is clear that Russia has not forgiven them yet."
tuscany.30.a: "These will help our men"
tuscany.27.t: "Tuscan Radicals Request Supplies"
tuscany.27.d: "The Radical movement inside Tuscany has requested that we send supplies to assist them in their revolution against Duke Leopold II and furthermore Austria should they intervene to support the Duke. Though we have stayed somewhat neutral in Italy in the past, our politicians have shown interest in helping the people of Central Italy who have been caught between the desires of Sardinia-Piedmont and Austria."
tuscany.27.a: "Set up a Supply Chain"
tuscany.27.b: "We cannot help them"
tuscany.31.t: "The British Send Supplies"
tuscany.31.d: "Due to support for our cause within the British parliament, the British have accepted our request for supplies. The Tuscan economy is not built to sustain war, let alone to supply a war effort, so these supplies will assist not only our troops but also our civilian industry in ensuring our economy does not collapse."
tuscany.31.a: "Thank our friends in parliament!"
tuscany.32.t: "Tuscans Request Withdrawal of our Garrison"
tuscany.32.d: "Ever since the Revolutions of 1848/, in which the Grand Duchy of Tuscany turned it's forces against us, we have maintained a modest garrison in the city of Florence to deter further revolutionary action. Leopold II eventually came around to accept our demands, which included a removal of the Tuscan Constitution, and our influence has been strong there ever since. Recently, however, the people of Tuscany have grown discontent with our influence being exerted over them. We have received a request from the Grand Duke himself that our garrisons expedite their exit from Tuscany so that a transition of power from the Duke towards a parliament and prime minister may occur unheeded.\n\n Many of our politicians claim that with the current European attitude in Italy not being in our favor, trying to intervene could come at an extreme cost. We also run the risk of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation to capture what Italian lands we do still hold."
tuscany.32.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
tuscany.33.t: "Austrian Garrison Withdrawn!"
tuscany.33.d: "The Austrian Empire has agreed to withdraw the rest of their garrison from Florence, likely due to international favor turning away from them and fear of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation. Now that the garrison is gone the transition of power from Duke Leopold II towards the Prime Minister and parliament can begin. Citizens in Florence celebrated throughout the night, this time without the Austrians watching."
tuscany.33.a: "We can all let out a sigh of relief now"
tuscany.34.t: "Invasion of the Papal Marche"
tuscany.34.d: "In order to reach Naples before Gariabldi and his forces do, we will need to enter the Papal Marche. Currently, France has garrisoned many troops in the Papal States and is actively protected their lands from any invasion. However, with Garibaldi announcing plans to march on Rome and Venice, France may be forced to allow our troops to occupy the Marche in order to stop Garibaldi from advancing his conquests."
tuscany.34.a: "If we must, we can force their hand"
tuscany.35.t: "Tuscany Requests to Enter the Papal Marche"
tuscany.35.d: "With a declaration from Garibaldi that he intends to conquer both Rome and Venice after capturing Southern Italy, there is increased fears within Europe of what kind of movements he could inspire if he is not stopped. Recently, a delegation from Tuscany has suggested that they be allowed to enter the Papal Marche and stop Garibaldi in Naples before he can continue with his plans."
tuscany.35.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
tuscany.36.t: "Invasion of the Papal Marche"
tuscany.36.d: "The French, likely forced to accept by international pressure, has conceded to our request to enter the Papal Marche. The Papal States has not taken kindly to our troops and has put up some resistance. Our troops should be able to handle them easily and then move on to the South to meet with Garibaldi's forces."
tuscany.36.a: "Onwards!"
tuscany.37.t: "Riots and Resistance"
tuscany.37.d: "Following the rise of a liberal government in Tuscany with aspirations for uniting Italy, many in our nation became sympathetic to their cause. Despite hopes to eventually annex the Tuscan government into our own, the Tuscans had approached us regarding merging our governments. When we declined, an open state of war was opened between our nations. Many have taken to the streets decrying this war as an act of aggression on our part. Radical and Liberal agents alike are painting our government to be elitist and opposed to liberalization in Italy."
tuscany.37.a: "We must crush them quickly"
tuscany.38.t: "The Death of François Jacques de Larderel"
tuscany.38.d: "Today Italy lost one of its great industrialists. François Jacques de Larderel died today in Florence. A native to France, the engineer from Tuscany was famous for developing a method to exploit the borax fumaroles in Tuscany in order to aid the Industrial capabilities using the water vapors. So great were the advancements made by de Larderel that Leopold II had awarded him the honor of Count of Montecerbolli."

sardinia_news.18.t: "Tuscany Empowers their Parliament"
sardinia_news.18.d: "In the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, led by Duke Leopold II, a great shift in governmental powers is underway. The Grand Duke has allowed the Prime Minister to become the head of government and begin preparations to revive the weakened parliament in Tuscany. Duke Leopold II will serve as Head of State in a similar fashion to the United Kingdom's monarchy. This shift away from Autocracy comes just a decade after the Austrian Empire forced the Duke to repeal the Tuscan constitution, and this action brings many questions as to the future of the Italian Peninsula."

NSC_focus_1848_revolution_legacy: "Legacy of the Revolutions of 1848"
NSC_focus_1848_revolution_legacy_desc: "The revolutions of 1848 consisted of several riots and uprisings organized by liberal and Carbonari committees with the first one starting in Messina on September 1, 1847 and ending with the Sicilian revolution that culminated in an independent Sicily for 16 months before it was crushed by King Ferdinand II’s troops on May 15, 1849.\n\n Despite having forced Ferdinand to grant a new, more liberal constitution, it all fell apart when the members of the chambers of deputes couldn’t agree on what oath that should be taken. This gave the king an excuse to dissolve the national parliament and crush all uprisings. Since the King has ruled as an absolute monarch, the revolutionary leaders who haven’t fled into exile has either been killed or are languishing in prison."
NSC_focus_piscane_expedition: "The Pisacane Expedition"
NSC_focus_piscane_expedition_desc: "Named after its leader, Carlo Pisacane, it was the brainchild of Giuseppe Mazzini. Its aim was to start an uprising in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and from there continue on to achieve Mazzini’s goal, a unified Italy based on Social Democratic Republicanism. In short to achieve what the revolutions of 1848 tried but failed to do However, the expedition met a bloody end when it reached Campania and failed to get the support of the local population. Pisacane himself died in the small town of Sanza, it is unclear if he committed suicide or was killed by the inhabitants."
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_reign: "The Reign of Ferdinand II"
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_reign_desc: "From being a fairly popular monarch in the early years of his reign he is now more known for his repressive tendencies. There is no love for the king among the liberals in his realm nor among the Sicilian inhabitants that remember the looting and raping committed by his troops. The savage shelling by a naval flotilla of the city of Messina, killing many civilians after the city had surrendered, has earned him the nickname re bomba, “King Bomb”."
NSC_focus_continue_political_arrest: "Continue Political Arrests"
NSC_focus_continue_political_arrest_desc: "It is clear after last years cowardly attempt against the king’s life and this years attempt to start an uprising in Campania that we cannot let our guard down. This, so called revolutionaries, must be hunted down. One of our top priorities is Giuseppe Mazzini tried and condemn to death, for his involvement in both attempts he is currently in hiding. He and his accomplices must be found. "
NSC_focus_political_repression: "Political Repression"
NSC_focus_political_repression_desc: "Despite our best efforts we still haven’t caught several troublemakers, including Giuseppe Mazzini. We still must keep the pressure up and crush all attempts to cause dissent."
NSC_focus_strengthen_troya_government: "Strengthen the Troya Government"
NSC_focus_strengthen_troya_government_desc: "Our trusted Prime minister, Ferdinando Troya has served us well, working hard to preserve and improve our interests. Such a loyal servant needs our full support, especially considering that his own brother, Carlo Troya, is popular among the troublemakers with his support of the Neo-Guelphism movement that wants to unite Italy and have the pope as its king!  We need to show who of the Troya brothers is the true patriot."
NSC_focus_kings_health: "The Health of the King"
NSC_focus_kings_health_desc: "Due to an assassination attempt by one of his own soldiers in 1856 the king suffered a bayonet wound that later got infected. Since then, the king’s health has never fully recovered, we can only pray that he will be better soon."
NSC_focus_secure_kingdom: "Secure the Kingdom"
NSC_focus_secure_kingdom_desc: "We have managed to keep the pressure up on the troublemakers, forcing them to go into hiding and focusing on staying alive instead of plotting against us. But there is trouble from abroad too, both France and England withdrew their ambassadors in 1856 when we, rightly, decided to follow our own path as a sovereign nation instead of listening to their advice. The most worrisome is the English hostility towards us. They seem to have forgotten the close friendship the house of Bourbon shared with them during the war against Napoleon. There are signs that they want to limit our sovereignty and take control of our Sicilian sulphur. We need to look for new allies the question is where?"
NSC_focus_milano_incident_legacy: "Legacy of the Milano Incident"
NSC_focus_milano_incident_legacy_desc: "Agesilao Milano, a young revolutionary offered to sacrifice his life for Italy by killing the King Ferdinand II. During a military review on December 8, 1856, he attacked the king with his bayonet and, hadn’t it been for the Kings pistol case deflecting the blow, he would have succeeded in ridding Italy of the tyrant.Agesilao Milano is now a martyr of the Italian cause, it will be up to others to take up the torch of a unified and free Italy!"
NSC_focus_military_analysis: "Analysis of the Military"
NSC_focus_military_analysis_desc: "Was Agesilao Milano really the only one in the entire army that harbored revolutionary thoughts?

NSC_focus_generals_state: "State of the Generals"
NSC_focus_generals_state_desc: "The soldiers that are supportive of a united and free Italy need someone who knows how to lead them. To that effect we must look among the generals to see if we can find anyone supportive of our cause."
NSC_focus_search_political_allies: "The Search for Political Allies"
NSC_focus_search_political_allies_desc: "The failed Pisacane expedition made it abundantly clear that only recruiting revolutionaries among our own people won’t be enough. We need international allies that can put pressure on King Ferdinand. Luckily, we have two promising alternatives; Relations between his majesty’s government and France and the United Kingdom are not the best anymore. Napoleon III of France has showed support for Italian independence before and seem to have a soft heart for Italy while, in Britain, the former chancellor and statesman, William Ewart Gladstone, has come out against King Ferdinand’s government in quite harsh terms calling it “the negation of God erected into a system of government”. Finding sympathizers in these countries shouldn’t be too hard."
NSC_focus_aquilas_count: "Count of Aquila"
NSC_focus_aquilas_count_desc: "The king’s brother is well known for his liberal views and is even considered to be the at forefront among the liberals in the royal court. Recruiting him to our cause would be an amazing boon to a united liberal Italy."

NSC_focus_recruit_filangieri_desc: "In retirement since 1855 after a falling out with a political rival. This old general would be another great asset to our cause. He knows how to lead armies as he showed in the crushing of the uprising in Sicily in 1849. But he also showed a liberal streak when he convinced the king to adopt the new constitution the same year, even if the king revoked it only a few months later. Filangieri has also proven himself as a prominent administrator during his time as governor of Sicily where he quickly restored law and order, paying off he debts the islands communes had accumulated during the fighting and restoring the old privileges. He wanted to address some of the islanders’ grievances by trying, and failing, to convince the king to allow a more autonomous Sicilian government. "

# Events
two_sicilies.1.t: "Dissolution of the Swiss Regiments"
two_sicilies.1.d: "Following a law proposed by the Swiss government which would make serving foreign militaries illegal by penalty of loss of citizenship, the Swiss regiments in our army turned to revolt. The Swiss 3rd Regiment started the revolt which eventually led to the Swiss Regiments marching towards Capodimonte to seek answers from King Francesco II. Fearing a larger riot, General Nunziante commanded the 13th Hunters Battalion to open fire on the Swiss soldiers. After this event the government has decided it best to dissolve the Swiss regiments and create separate foreign battalions for foreign troops to circumvent laws like the one in Switzerland. Though a few soldiers remain, many of the Swiss and Bavarian volunteers have left the army."

two_sicilies.3.d: "Over 300 prisoners have escaped from a Prison on Ponza Island after they were assisted in a prison break. Many of the prisoners were political prisoners, including many notorious figures from the revolutions of 1848. The Neapolitan authorities have since re-established order at the penitentiary and deployed the Real Marina to survey the surrounding waters for vessels that could be harboring the escaped convicts."

two_sicilies.5.d: "Supports of Mazzini in Genoa were apprehended trying to hand out letters in support of rioting and support of the failed Pisacane expedition. Two of the leading conspirators have been identified as Jessie M. White and her boyfriend Alberto Mario. While nothing major has occurred and the riot did not spread far, Cavour has ordered the police to be on alert for any remaining Mazzinians who might challenge the Piedmont government. The conspirators who are captured are expected to be exiled, same as Mazzini once was."

Conspirators were wearing tricolor armbands and assaulted the city garrison. Luckily, the military command was able to sound the alarm by firing three cannon shots from the Old Fortress. The riot spreaded quickly but reinforcements from the military were easily able to trap the insurrectionists that had attempted to fight on. \n\n Seven of the insurrectionists were lined up on the wall of the Colo palace, where they had attempted to hold out, and shot by order of Major Giovanni Traditi.

two_sicilies.7.d: "The Revolutions of 1848 were very chaotic for our Kingdom. Our armies originally joined the Italian coalition in fighting the Austrians, but when a revolt in Palermo turned the entire island of Sicily into open revolt a response was necessary. Naples also faced a major revolt which prompted the creation of a constitution for the Kingdom, however, this did little to battle the flames of revolution and Sicily could only be calmed after our armies sieged down the cities of the island. The constitution was revoked and conservative ministers took over government positions at the behest of Ferdinand II."

 sardinia.45.d: "Agrarianism has constituted the vast majority of the Sardinian economy for as long as many can remember. As the economies of Europe begin to shift towards Industrialization—and Piedmont along with it, the island of Sardinia has been left underdeveloped and to be exploited for resources to fuel mainland Industries. The situation in Sardinia is considered volatile by much of the Piedmontese ruling class, hampering any efforts to change the economic or political makeup of the island any further. The question remains on whether Industrialization efforts should be forwarded to the island, or if it can remain strictly a strategic installment, and be of use in other sectors of our economy."

##Monaco

monaco.1.t: "The Status of Monaco"
monaco.1.d: "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco was transferred to the Kingdom of Sardinia as a protectorate. The Treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was overall devastating for Monaco and much of the wealth of the nation was lost, which was further inflamed when a majority of the nation declared independence during the Revolutions of 1848. Since then the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area. As the struggle for unification is underway, many question what status Monaco will play in it. Shall Monaco be transferred to France along with Savoy and Nice in exchange for French support, or should we fight to ensure Monaco remains a part of the Italian sphere?"

monaco.7.d: "As the meeting is getting underway the topic of Monaco's future is what is on everyone's mind.

We can either try to enforce the protectorate status to be made more permanent or push for annexation of Monaco into our nation."

#monaco.9.t: "The Status of Monaco"
#monaco.9.d: "In the treaty between us and Sardinia-Piedmont to cede Nice and Savoy in return for our alliance in the war against Austria we had expected that Monaco would be returned to our nation. Monaco had been apart of Napoleon I's empire and was ceded to Sardinia during the Congress of Vienna. While officially signing the treaty today it was revealed that Monaco would not be transferred to our nation. While disappointing there is nothing we can do in this situation."

The Sardinian officials have announced that they wish to sign a treaty that will ensure that the Protectorate status of Monaco is not disturbed while their attempts at unification go on. It is unclear if this is the best option yet, but it is certainly better than occupation. Many in our government say we should ask to be transferred to France if Sardinia takes that option, though some have pointed out that with the rebellions in the country annexation may be better than the status quo.

monaco.14.d: "The treaty of Stupinigi, signed by both the former Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars confirmed our place under the protection and oversight of Sardinia-Piedmont. The treaty distinctly specifies “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon during negotiations despite the uneasy relationship between our Royal House and the House of Savoy. Consequently, weariness over lofty taxes and blatant abuse of power has pushed Rocabrüna and Mentone, which make up over 95% of our territory, into declaring union with Sardinia-Piedmont—an action to which Sardinia wholehearted embraced and has since sent three militia brigades to enforce. The destabilization and stagnation of Monaco leaves for a generally uncertain future, however, our noble-hearted and stalwart Prince Charles III, stands firm, ready to guide our nation through any storm or sickness to come."

sardinia.6.t: "Diplomacy with the British"
sardinia.6.d: "Diplomacy with the British rests largely in the friendship of Camillo Benso and the British Legation in Turin - James Hudson. James Hudson himself is quite the italophile, and his position in Turin - held since the days before Benso was prime minister - has convinced him of the need of support for the unification movement. Though he faces some ridicule at home for his position as a favorable ally of Camillo Benso, he will be a key instrument for Sardinia in the attempts to get British support for Unification."

sardinia.7.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia"
sardinia.7.d: "James Hudson - the British Legation to Sardinia-Piedmont - has an equal number of allies in enemies in the British Government. The Queen herself is rumored to claim he is too much a friend of the Italians than the British, but nobody in the government will tell you that he is a bad diplomat. Despite his friendship with Cavour and support for Italian unification, Hudson has always kept British interests in mind. Now that the Sardinians are looking for allies in their hopes for Unification communication between our nations is at an all time high. \n The most pressing matter for the Sardinians currently in which they hope to see our position in the case of the Cagliari - a Piedmontese mailing ship with two Brits in the crew which was captured by the neapolitans. The Case is meant to go to parliament where Sardinian officials will make their plea and the fate of British and Sardinian relations will be decided. The date of the session is set for mid-1858."

The British parliament has agreed to hear the case during the Spring of 1858. It will be here that Sardinian officials will finally be able to plead their case directly to the British Government. Hudson has put in his best words for our cause, but the outcome of this arrangement will be uncertain until it is over."

However, Nigra informed Henri of an already existing alliance between Russia and Sardinia-Piedmont which is now cause for concern in the French leadership.

It is expected that the French Empire will seek to gain Nice and Savoy, having previously occupied them briefly during the Napoleonic wars, french authorities are well aware that without said territories, southern France will be left with a broad breach in it’s geographical defensibility. While Sardinia-Piedmont’s ruling class believes in the principles of nationalism, in which Savoy would undisputedly belong to the French nation, Nice has long since been a core Italian land. The loss of Nice would be an evident circumstantial dismissal of our core principals, and would likely infuriate the Piedmontese populace. Additionally, Napoleon III insists on the marriage of Prince Napoleon Bonaparte and Victor Emanuel II’s eldest daughter- Maria Clotilde, to solidify our alliance. Prince Napoleon has an egregious reputation of partying and other lewd activities, and would surely mistreat Maria.The King is not eager to see the marriage go through, but is prepared to make the sacrifice for Italy."

Our ministers have suggested that we offer them an alliance that could see us taking Galicia in a war with Austria in return for our support and recognition of Sardinia as the rightful nation to unite Italy. The lack of an alliance with another major from Sardinia means we could support this war without risk of a European Conflict rising up.

As the two diplomatic masterminds prepare to dictate the terms of the alliance, Italia Turrita holds her breath."

sardinia.92.t: "Our Goals"
sardinia.92.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont’s aspirations have unique ramifications to be deliberated at Plombieres. The memory of having been defeated by the Austrians alongside our Italian allies in 1848 still lingers in the minds of many of Europe's upper classes. Affording us much difficulty in voicing our ambitions to the European powers of the world stage. Our participation in the Crimean war assured the grievance of Italian Unification would become a topic of debate amongst European circles once again. The upcoming Plombieres arrangement with Emperor Napoleon III of the French Empire provides us with the opportunity to align France under our ambitions to expel Austria from influencing Italy and our long standing goal of uniting the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia with our own. Control over the resource-rich Po-Valley should afford us with de-facto geopolitical and economic homogeneity over the Peninsula, regardless of probable French notions with the remainder of the peninsula."
sardinia.92.a: "Let's hope for a strong alliance"
sardinia.93.t: "Our Goals"
sardinia.93.d: "Plombieres will be a great meeting for our nation. After the Congress of Vienna our power in Italy gradually decreased, but now as Sardinia-Piedmont seeks to make a name for itself in Italy, this could be an opportunity for our return to our legacy in Italy. The goal of our ministers is to from an alliance with Piedmont, and ensure the Austrians will declare war so that our side in on the defensive in the war. The hope is to eventually create an Italian Confederation which will include states both allied and reliant on us."
sardinia.93.a: "May the French Empire rise again"
sardinia.94.t: "The First Day"
sardinia.94.d: "Following Cavour’s departure from Turin, it was known that he would be traveling to switzerland.  With only the King and the Piedmontese military commander, General La Marmora, being aware that Cavour’s final destination was to Plombières, and Cavour having rented a fine cottage on the outskirts of the small town, his meeting with Napoleon III is about to be underway. With expectations for Napoleon to arrive in front of Cavour’s cottage by the afternoon in a carriage, in which the two statements will take a stroll through the quiet streets of Plombières discussing the terms of the anticipated alliance. The leadership composition of the alliance’s forces, a suitable casus belli against Austria, and the structuring of Italy upon victory are primary concerns."
sardinia.94.a: "Let the meeting begin!"
sardinia.95.t: "Plombieres - Casus Belli"
sardinia.95.d: "Neither Napoleon III, nor Cavour are eager to accept the blame for causing the impending war. Napoleon has made clear his determination to support Sardinia-Piedmont with all his strength under the single condition that the war against Austria would not be fought for revolutionary cause, and can be justified in diplomatic terms. The obvious contenders for proposal in order to sooth Napoleon's concerns are that of Austria’s consistent violation of trade treaty obligations, which may be too weak a justification for a use of aggression; as well as that of the Austrian garrison in Bologna, to which the Papacy has not permitted to indefinitely reside. While the garrison in Bologna may prove a sufficient justification and gain favor among other European powers, French troops are currently stationed in Rome, and the parallels may raise the question of French hypocrisy."
sardinia.95.a: "Trade Treaty Violations"
sardinia.95.b: "Bologna Garrison"
sardinia.96.t: "Plombieres - Casus Belli"
sardinia.96.d: "The other side of our alliance has offered up two possible casus belli that could be used against the Austrians. However, neither are suitable to use in order to wage a war of the scale we need to. The proposed casus belli's being enforcing trade treaty obligations, and using the Bologna Garrison by the Austrians as an excuse for war. With the parallels between our troops in Rome and the Austrians in Bologna, using that as a casus belli could be seen as hypocritical. The trade treaty obligations would not be strong enough to be seen as legitimate cause for war."
sardinia.96.a: "We Might have another Plan..."
sardinia.97.t: "Casus Belli - A Different Approach"
sardinia.97.d: "With our confirming that the two prior suggested Casus Belli would be too weak to wage a war on, our politicians have managed to formulate quite the plan in order to not only provide a cause for war, but to ensure Austria is the attacker. Using the fact that Duchy of Medna and Reggio leader Francis V had refused to accept Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the Modense citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-Allied government it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opportunity to make a statement about Austrian influence in the Italian Peninsula without directly going to war. The outrage in Vienna might just be enough to cause them to go to war."
sardinia.97.a: "Ingenious!"
sardinia.98.t: "Casus Belli - A Different Approach"
sardinia.98.d: "As expected, the trade treaty violations by Austria were considered by Napoleon to be insufficient grounds for war. Napoleon also displayed reluctance to accept the use of the Bologna garrison as a pretext. However, it has transpired that Napoleon has an alternative proposal that he believes could prove a sufficient justification. Using the recent debacle in which the Duke of Modena and Reggio, Francis V refused to recognize Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the modenese citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-allied government, it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opportunity to make a public announcement denouncing Austrian oppression in the peninsula. The subsequent outrage the proclamation might cause just may be enough to cause them to declare themselves the aggressor."
sardinia.98.a: "Ingenious!"
sardinia.99.t: "Political Structure of Italy"
sardinia.99.d: "The geopolitical makeup of Italy, should the war against Austria prove successful, is a point of tension between Sardinia-Piedmont and the French Empire, and may cause a degree of political fracturing within the alliance after the war’s completion. The French maintain the goal of gaining influence across the peninsula through the means of an Italian Confederation, reminiscent of that of which operates in germany. This directly opposes the voter-backed agenda that has become popularized throughout much of Sardinia-Piedmont, advocating for the complete removal of Foreign influence from Italy. Consequently, Sardinia-Piedmont conversely harbors the goal of creating a Northern Italian Kingdom within said confederation, should it’s nationalistic agenda prove unfruitful."
sardinia.99.a: "This will be an interesting topic"
sardinia.100.t: "Our Position on the Confederation"
sardinia.100.d: "As the French prepare to lay out their plan for the Italian Peninsula, we must begin to think about whether the confederation is something that we should go along with. Naturally, we can always give the French our assurances now and see if the future allows us to change the agreement, but we are not in a good position to deny the French goal of domination in Italy. With that we are stuck in this position, with the hope to escape at first chance or at the very least to renegotiate the terms of the confederation."
sardinia.100.a: "We will see what the future holds"
sardinia.101.t: "The North of Italy"
sardinia.101.d: "Under the current plans for the political restructuring of Italy, Cavour and Napoleon agreed that Sardinia-Piedmont under the New Italian confederation ought to be awarded Lombardy-Venetia, what was formerly Venetian Istria, the Duchies of Modena,and  Parma, as well as the Papal Legislations in Romagna to form the Kingdom of Northern Italy. This would see Austria entirely removed from the Italian peninsula, and the creation of a new powerful Independent Italian state."
sardinia.101.a: "Interesting..."
sardinia.102.t: "Central Italy"
sardinia.102.d: "Central Italy would be reorganized under the rule of Roberto I, Duke of Parma. Roberto, being an adolescent, currently entrusts state legislation with Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois as acting regent. France clearly believes that Louise d’Artois may be more akin to following a policy of clienthood with the French Empire due to her francophone upbringing. This new Central Italian Kingdom would be awarded with the former Duchy of Tuscany, as well as the Marche and Umbrian former Papal Legislations. The Pope in compensation, would be nominated honorary head of the confederation, not that the Papacy has much of a choice."
sardinia.102.a: "Not like we’re in much of a position to complain."
sardinia.104.t: "The South of Italy"
sardinia.104.d: "A fair degree of uncertainty came with discussions on the South of the peninsula, more likely than not, it would remain under the rule of the Bourbon monarchs of the Two Sicilies. However, it is unclear whether or not the Bourbon rulers would be open to the idea of confederation, should they be unable to be convinced of the merits of Neapolitan integration into the proposed confederation, it is almost assured that the Two Sicilies would be awarded to a Bonapartist relative of Napoleon III."
sardinia.104.a: "The final piece of the puzzle"
sardinia.105.t: "Day Two"
sardinia.105.d: "After a long day of negotiations, promises, and signing treaties the previous day, Napoleon is due to pick up Cavour once again to discuss the proposed marriage and finalize the terms of the Franco-Sardinian Entente."
sardinia.105.a: "Lets get it going"
sardinia.106.t: "Military Composition"
sardinia.106.d: "The first and foremost topic of the day perhaps might be the most dire, is that in regards to the military composition of the alliance. Given the war is over Italian soil, Cavour understands that having Sardinia-Piedmont lead the Entente forces in the conflict would constitute a symbolic vengeance for the defeat in 1848. However, the French consider it important that they show dominance in Italy, and use the war as a political ploy for vengeance over the Congress of Vienna’s terms. Whoever leads the military alliance will gain quite the sum of political utility post-war."
sardinia.106.a: "Allow the French to lead"
sardinia.106.b: "Request that we lead"
sardinia.107.t: "The Military Composition"
sardinia.107.d: "As the Piedmontese have sent their request for how the military alliance will be structured, and who will ultimately lead the efforts against Austria there is much to consider. As the dominant power in Europe compared to the Italians it would be more appropriate for us to lead the armies in Italy, however, the Italians are very nationalistic people and the presence of strong Italian leaders could pay off to rally the populace and inspire troops. Either way, the leader of the war will be an important position."
sardinia.107.a: "Accept Lead"
sardinia.107.b: "Deny Piedmont Lead, We just take charge"
sardinia.107.c: "Give the Italians Command"
sardinia.108.t: "Preparations for War"
sardinia.108.d: "Given that our generals are to occupy a majority of the leadership positions during the upcoming war with Austria, it is necessary that we begin discussing strategy and tactics. Given our nations prior experience in fighting the Austrians in Italy, there should be much to learn from the past to implement in the new campaign."

With our generals at the helm the armies of Austria will be easily crushed, and the Hapsburgs shall be removed from the Italian Peninsula once and for all!"
PIE_FRA_Plombieres_France_War: "It is of little surprise, but the French have declined our request to lead the military composition of our joint force. The French have the benefit of being a recognized power in Europe, so despite our performance in the Crimean War they have opted to use their generals in most of the command positions. Despite this, our joint force shall have no difficulty removing the Austrian menace from the peninsula."
sardinia.109.a: "Another Topic Settled"
sardinia.110.t: "The Royal Marriage"
sardinia.110.d: "In order to consolidate the new alliance, Napoleon has insisted on having Napoleon III’s rather disgraceful cousin marry the eldest daughter of King Victor Emanuel. There are many reasons as to why the King has been hesitant. The Emperor's brother is not known for his loyalty to companions, and his age difference between the kings daughter it not to ignored. It would not be a prestigious marriage in regards to Sardinia-Piedmont’s standing, but the King is willing to make the sacrifice in order to secure the alliance."

Despite some minor protest from the Italian side, they have relunctantly agreed to host the marriage in Turin at a later date. With that the alliance with Sardinia-Piedmont is sealed."
PIE_FRA_Plombieres_Marriage_Denied: "The Italian Side has reacted quite violently at the previously discussed marriage between Napoleon's cousin Louis and the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel. Citing the difference in age, and Louis' reputation, the Italians have requested that this ceremonial seal of our alliance be cast aside.

These States, together with the addition of Venetia, which is to remain firmly in Austrian hands, will be conjoined in an “Italian Federation” overseen by Austria and France. In compensation, Napoleon III has halfheartedly agreed to allow us annexation of Parma, beside Lombardy. This peace both assures the continuity of foreign domination over Italy, and leaves us in a position of vulnerability to which the continuation of the Risorgimento seems unlikely.

sardinia.129.t: "Restoration of Leopold?"
sardinia.129.d: "Renowned war hero and general Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora has recently sent us an insulting letter demanding the restoration of the former foreign rulers of Modena, Parma, and Tuscany, as well as the return of the Bolognese Papal Legislations to the Papal States. The coward has bent the knee to the recent Franco-Austrian agreement."
sardinia.129.a: "Tell La Marmora we have shredded his letter with the utmost regard"
sardinia.130.t: "The Villafranca Settlement"
sardinia.130.d: "In recent events, it appears as though Napoleon III has betrayed his promises to Sardinia-Piedmont, dealing behind their backs with the Austrian’s, and agreeing upon the restoration of the conservative governments in Central Italy. This presents us with a unique opportunity, Sardinia-Piedmont has a natural hatred for the Austrians, and now the French have cast aside the Sardinians' favor. If we intervene and advocate in favor of Sardinia-Piedmont, we could not only gain their favor, but also establish a counterweight to French influence in Italy."
sardinia.130.a: "Put forth our statement of advocacy for Sardinia Piedmont"
sardinia.131.t: "Britain Intervenes"
sardinia.131.d: "In a recent turn of events, the United Kingdom, though with its own motives no doubt, has intervened, advocating for the Sardinian cause for unification with the Central Italian States as compensation for Sardinia-Piedmont’s denial of Venetia. With this change in opinion, the position of the international powers on this issue has staunchly turned against French demands. It has become clear to the world that Napoleon III seeks to rearrange the borders of Europe to the benefit of France, rather than over any justifiable moral cause.The French threat to leave Sardinia-Piedmont to the mercy of Austria if the treaty of Zurich is not upheld may not have merit afterall."

sardinia.132.a: "Let us begin negotiations"
sardinia.133.t: "The Turin Re-negotiations"
sardinia.133.d: "Although Napoleon has already agreed to allow us annexation of the newly formed Italian Central Provinces, perhaps we can negotiate the retainment of Nice, Italian speaking for centuries and defiantly loyal, the French acquisition of Nice remained questionable ever since the meetings in Plombieres took place."
sardinia.133.a: "We have to take what we can get"
sardinia.133.b: "See what we can do"
sardinia.134.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont seeks to maintain Nice"
sardinia.134.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont has returned with a counter offer to the current state of the \"Treaty of Turin.\" They hope to maintain control over Nice and hand over only Savoy. Accepting might help to ease tensions with the new Italian state and would help to decrease British interest in Italian affairs; however, the public might not have a favorable view of such terms."
sardinia.134.a: "Accept their proposal"
sardinia.134.b: "Stand firm"
sardinia.135.t: "Napoleon Accepts"
sardinia.135.d: "Napoleon, seeing Britain’s increasing interest in Italian affairs, and seeking repaired relations with our Kingdom, has re-considered his claim on Nice, and decided upon allowing our retainment of the territory."
sardinia.135.a: "Avanti!"
sardinia.136.t: "Napoleon Declines"
sardinia.136.d: "Napoleon, with French public opinion in mind, has declined our proposal to retain our rule over Nice. Though the loss of Nice means the loss and assimilation of native Italian lands, Our acquisition of the Central Italian States should distract domestic opposition."

England, Sardinia-Piedmont, France, Prussia, and Austria will have voting power in the conference, though as the losing side in the war, Austria's position is more ceremonial than anything else.

Pasquale Urso was sentenced to 50 beatings and 30 days of isolation for stealing flour, Antonio Margiotta for stealing timber and grapes from a vineyard on the island. Margiotta was forced to run around the island with the stolen goods tied around his body. As if things couldn't be any stranger, the Republic of Santo Sefano has also begun handing out death sentences for some who do not uphold the statute. Giuseppe Sabia was guilty of stealing a goat.

Much to our disappointment the Papal troops were assisted by local peasants and Zambianchi was forced to retreat.\n\n Our government now fears the reaction of France, an ally of the Papal States.

The soldiers of the Neapolitan Hunters were no match for the accuracy of Garibaldi's Hunters and a brave bayonet counterattack. Though initially successfull, Bixio and many of the officers of the Expedition were prepared to retreat when Garibaldi himself rode to the front of the columns declaring that \"Italians, here we must die!\" Seeing the sight of Garibaldi and the morale of the volunteers, the Bourbons retreated in such a fashion that even Garibaldi was too stunned to order a counterattack."

The disorganized column has enacted forced requisitions on townsfolk in their wake. In the town of Alcamo the column took fire from citizens who heard of Garibaldi's great victory. Rumors of the victory, and that the men of the expedition were supernatural forces, inspired the citizens of Partinico to prepare an ambush for the advancing Bourbon Army. Once in the town center the soldiers were fired upon by citizens. The soldiers managed to respond by burning down over 60 houses, robbing many, and killing some women and children. However, the Bourbon army was already weakened and refused to be stuck in the town, retreating and leaving the wounded. \n\n When Garibaldi arrived in the town he found the citizens had brutally murdered the wounded soldiers left behind. Some were killed in brutal ritualistic killings and tossed on fires of the buildings. One woman, when questioned why the bodies were not buried, responded that \"They do not deserve burial; dogs must eat them.\" "

The Bourbon army has been unable to answer to any of the advancements of the Southern Army. In an incredible series of events, Bourbon general Fileno Briganti was even executed by his own men who were convinced his failures to defeat the advancing armies despite numerical advantages were due to misplaced loyalties.

Since the initial act of Mutual recognition in 1802 through U.S. Consular Agent François de Navoni, cooperation between our two states has vastly expanded. On February 7, 1839, the United states accepted the credentials of Count Augusto Avogadro de Collobiano as the first charge d'affaires in Washington from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, one year later, the United States established a legation in Turin with the first U.S. charge d'affaires presenting his credentials on September 15, 1840. U.S. involvement in the evacuation of Italian Patriots during the wars of 1848 still lingers in the memories of many Sardinian citizens, as well as the minds of the Austrian authorities. The United States, being a fervent defender of self determination and democracy, very well favors our nation. Although, it has become apparent that any direct support from the United States is unlikely, as internal strife and the ideals of manifest destiny gripe the increasingly divided young nation."

Since signing a universally amiable treaty of trade and commerce on November 16, 1838 when U.S. delegates met with King Carlo Alberto, Emanuele II’s father, our two states have enjoyed a pleasant and increasingly advantageous relationship. Shipments of cotton depart the southern states for Sardinian textile manufacturers, where the material plays a pivotal role as a prime material in the production of Piedmontese textile products. Similarly to other northern italian textiles, the textiles from our manufacturers themselves are held amongst the highest regard in the consumerist economies of the northern states. The periodical increase in demand for raw materials, especially cotton due to our ever-expanding industries over the past couple of decades has left Sardinia-Piedmont in a state of near dependency on the lucrative cotton trade with the United States."

The United States greatly values this arrangement, seeing the continuity of its usage as a U.S. docking bay and refueling station within the Mediterranean Sea as of utmost strategic importance. Many conservative politicians in parliament see the agreement as a breach of Sardinia-Piedmont’s national security, citing that in addition to the arrangement displaying subordination, the United States may use its preemptive advantage against us in the case of future conflict between our two states, and advocate for its immediate repeal. While it is universally understood that the United States would be understanding of our rapid change in policy, and retaliation is not a concern, withdrawing such a concession would surely strain relations with the United States, a nation widely considered to be a close confrère of our kingdom."

sardinia.223.a: "We must win this war!"
sardinia.224.t: "The Turin Exhibition"
sardinia.224.d: "Following an unsuccessful exhibition in Turin in 1850, it was decided that another exhibition should be held in Turin in 1858. The innovations present in the exhibitions and fairs in Paris and London give much prestige to the minds of those respective nations. The Turin Exhibition included many public industrial representatives, showing off work done by Cavour over the last decade to increase the industrial capabilities of Piedmont. However, despite the impressive changes since 1858, it is still evident that Italy is struggling to implement innovations already present in Europe into the industrial sector. King Victor Emmanuel and Cavour were seen together during the exhibition."
sardinia.224.a: "Someday, we will reach greatness"
sardinia.225.t: "An Interesting Opportunity"
sardinia.225.d: "A possible opportunity has come to the table as the plans for supporting Italian Unification are being developed. Discussion that Russia could put troops on the border of Galicia to distract the Austrian army have brought up suggestions that the same could be done in the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova. Facilitating an arms deal with the principalities may lead the Austrians to fear an invasion from the East, distracting more of their army. The decision will have to be made if we should attempt this so the arms can be sent right away should the principalities accept."
sardinia.225.a: "Send an Envoy to the Principalities"
sardinia.225.b: "It's a waste of time"
sardinia.226.t: "A Proposition from France"
sardinia.226.d: "The French Government has offered as an interesting deal. They are hoping to facilitate an arms deal with our nation in order to alarm the Austrians. The French hope that by sending us weapons the Austrians will send more of their army east, distracting them from the western front should war start. Though the French arms would certainly be useful, some are hesitant to accept should Austria not take kindly to the deal going through."
sardinia.226.a: "The arms would be useful..."
sardinia.226.b: "We cannot accept"
sardinia.227.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts the Deal"
sardinia.227.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer to facilitate an arms deal. The hope is now that Austria will put more troops in the East, away from any Western front-line. The arms are now on their way."
sardinia.227.a: "Hopefully this works"
sardinia.228.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Declines the Deal"
sardinia.228.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] declined our offer for arms, likely fearing that facilitating the deal would harm relations with Austria. Though unfortunate that the deal could not be made, many in our government saw the offer as a waste of our resources anyway."
sardinia.228.a: "Oh Well"
sardinia.229.t: "Danubian Principalities Strike a Deal with France"
sardinia.229.d: "Our diplomats recently discovered that the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova have accepted arms shipments sent from France. This has caused concerns that the French have managed to convince the Romanian states to join the war in Italy. It may be wise to maintain troops on the border of the principalities in order to safeguard against a possible attack from this front."
sardinia.229.a: "Damn those Frenchmen"
sardinia.230.t: "Maria Adelaide and Duca di Genova arrive in La Spezia"
sardinia.230.d: "With Carlo Alberto and Vittorio Emanuele’s two sister ships finally docking into Piedmontese harbors, the original accord signed with the United Kingdom in 1853 has now been entirely fulfilled, marking a notable milestone in Sardinian Maritime Re–armament. The four frigates will form the backbone of the Sardinian navy until more formidable models can be commissioned."
sardinia.230.a: "They will make foreboding flagships for the Regia Marina!"
sardinia.231.t: "Maritime Assets"
sardinia.231.d: "The urgent exigency for modern steam or other screw-driven vessels to substitute the since antiquated models of the Sardinian fleet has become ever apparent to the Sardinian legislature since Cavour’s inauguration in 1850. Efforts to revitalize the maritime capabilities of Sardinia-Piedmont by the Cavour cabinet have been substantial, with many preeminent warships being added to Sardinia’s minimal array of naval assets. As acting Minister of the Navy, in 1853 Cavour signed a series of accords with the United Kingdom including a variety of orders for vessels to be constructed in the United Kingdom for the Sardinian fleet, including that of four advanced screw-propeller driven steam frigates. Two of these vessels have since been commissioned in the Regia Marina."
sardinia.231.a: "Il Mar Tirreno è nostro a governare!"
sardinia.232.t: "State of the Economy"
sardinia.232.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way since Camillo Benso di Cavour’s appointment in 1850. Cavour immediately began work on constructing a modern economy for the nation- Closing excessive monasteries, reducing the amount of benefices, and correcting the nation's lopsided spending deficit. In order to finance major public works projects and extensive industrial expansion, as well as to pay off war indemnities to Austria acquired after the war of 1848, Cavour masterfully floated vast internal and international loans, particularly from France and the United Kingdom. The subsequent subsidization of private railway companies and Sardinia-Piedmont diverse artisan-based Industrial sectors has led to the nation’s rise to becoming the most advanced and modern state within the Italian peninsula."
sardinia.232.a: "We must continue to strengthen the economy"
sardinia.233.t: "Infrastructural Developments"
sardinia.233.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont began subsidizing broad rail projects in the mid 1840s, connecting many major economic sectors throughout the nation such as Genoa and Turin, which in-turn lowered the cost of the transport of goods and persons, as well as provided a broad array of occupations to support middle class Piedmontese citizens.Cavour’s cabinet has identified connecting Turin to French and Swiss economic centers, such as Geneva and Lyon as of primary economic concern."
sardinia.233.a: "Very well, authorize drafting for the Rail lines"
sardinia.234.t: "Sound Toll Payments"
sardinia.234.d: "As part of the Copenhagen Convention, which granted free passage to European shipping companies through the Sound Dunes, we are expected to pay a portion of the fees. Though costly, the agreement will make merchant deals between our nations much easier."
sardinia.234.a: "Let the Trading Begin!"
sardinia.235.t: "Sound Toll Payments"
sardinia.235.d: "As part of the Copenhagen Convention, which granted free passage to European shipping companies through the Sound Dunes, European nations whose shipping companies would benefit from the convention were inclined to pay certain fees. The parliament of Sardinia-Piedmont has recently approved the transfer of funds to pay for those fees, meaning trade between our nations can now flurish."
sardinia.235.a: "Let the Trading Begin!"
sardinia.236.t: "Postal Convention with England"
sardinia.236.d: "The Parliament has recently negotiated a new postal convention with the English. This will help international mail travel much quicker and with less hoops to jump through. Part of the agreement details increased communication between our two nations and the creation of mail lines supported by steam ships."

sardinia.237.a: "Maybe I can have an Italian Pen Pal"
sardinia.238.t: "Signal Law with England"
sardinia.238.d: "A new law has been signed with the English regarding the construction of signals for dangerous parts of the Italian coasts. As naval cooperation and trade between our nations has increased, so have accidents and incidents that could have been avoided."
sardinia.238.a: "The seas will be much safer now"
sardinia.239.t: "Signal Law with Sardinia-Piedmont"
sardinia.239.d: "A new law has been signed with Sardinia-Piedmont regarding the construction of signals for dangerous parts of the Italian coasts. As naval cooperation and trade between our nations has increased, so have accidents and incidents that could have been avoided."
sardinia.239.a: "The seas will be much safer now"
sardinia.240.t: "Postal Agreement with Modena"
sardinia.240.d: "Our Parliament recently negotiated a new postal convention in cooperation with the Duchy of Modena. This new accord is expected to improve the promptness of the flow of international mail between our two states due to the removal of prior inflated bureaucracy regarding the traversal of merchandise. The agreement in-part details extended cooperation in the fields of communication and the creation of mail lines supported by steam ships along with vestigial land routes."
sardinia.240.a: "I'll send a letter to the Duke"
sardinia.241.t: "Postal Agreement with Sardinia-Piedmont"
sardinia.241.d: "A new postal convention has recently been negotiated with Sardinia-Piedmont. This will help international mail travel much quicker and with less hoops to jump through. Part of the agreement details increased communication between our two nations and the creation of mail lines supported by steam ships and land routes."
sardinia.241.a: "Let the mail flow"
sardinia.242.t: "Influence in Italy"
sardinia.242.d: "Our agents are spread throughout the North of the Italian Peninsula. Through cooperation with local national societies and hunting clubs our agents have been able to build a network of resistance to the autocratic governments of the North. This network spreads support for our unification movement, while arming resistance movements."
sardinia.242.a: "We must cripple these nations from the inside"
sardinia.243.t: "Large-Scale Resistance"
sardinia.243.d: "Suspected to be supported by Sardinian agents, networks of pro-unification radicals have managed to increase distrust of our government and the monarchy. A large network of resistance has formed in the North of Italy that is crippling the stability of our nation."
sardinia.243.a: "This must be stopped!"
sardinia.244.t: "Potenza Uprising"
sardinia.244.d: "According to recent reports from the Basilicata region, Lucanian insurgents led by Nicolo Mignogna attacked and seized the Lucanian Capital of Potenza from its 400-man Bourbon garrison. The proposed Bourbon provisional government as indicated by Neapolitan general Floras, commander of Neapolitan forces in Puglia, has since reported the complete rejection of Bourbon administration by the local Lazzaroni. The four hundred gendarmes ordered to garrison the capital city of Potenza at first appeared to yield to the imposing popular manifestation, but directly afterwards, at the cry of \"Long live the King! and Death to the Nation!\" set up by Captain Castagna, they fought futilely against the insurrectionist forces, but were repulsed and fled, leaving seven dead, three wounded, and fifteen prisoners to the rebel Lucanians. Those who were dispersed surrendered, one after the other."
sardinia.244.a: "Basilicata Falls…"
sardinia.245.t: "Potenza Uprising"
sardinia.245.d: "According to recent reports from the Basilicata region, Lucanian insurgents led by Nicolo Mignogna attacked and seized the Lucanian Capital of Potenza from its 400-man garrison. The proposed provisional government as indicated by Neapolitan general Floras, commander of our forces in Puglia, has since reported the complete rejection of Bourbon administration by the local Lazzaroni. The four hundred gendarmes ordered to garrison the capital city of Potenza at first appeared to yield to the imposing popular manifestation, but directly afterwards, at the cry of \"Long live the King! and Death to the Nation!\" set up by Captain Castagna, they fought valiantly against the insurrectionist forces, but were begrudgingly repulsed."
sardinia.245.a: "They don't know what's good for them..."
sardinia.246.t: "Reggio-Calabria falls to the forces of Garibaldi"
sardinia.246.d: "In Calabria Garibaldi has found the opposition even feebler than in Sicily.  Although the Neapolitan generals had 16,000 soldiers stationed in the toe of Italy prepared to apprehend Garibaldi upon his crossing of the straight, they put up little resistance and many submitted without firing a shot; one battalion surrendered to six wandering garibaldini who had got lost. According to witness accounts from Naples, the Neapolitan minister of war announced the following morning that he was departing for Calabria to defeat Garibaldi and retake Reggio, but then changed his mind that same afternoon due to considerations of his presence in the capital being essential to prevent disorder."
sardinia.246.a: "Even the people of Naples are discontent"
sardinia.247.t: "Reggio-Calabria falls to the forces of Garibaldi"
sardinia.247.d: "In Calabria the Piedmontese-backed lazzaroni laid siege to the city of Reggio-Calabria upon crossing the strait of Messina. Although 16,000  of our brave soldiers were stationed in the toe of Italy prepared to apprehend Garibaldi upon his crossing of the straight, they were vastly outnumbered, being no match for the savage mob, the survivors were forced to pull out of the establishment to regroup with the remainder of our forces in northern Calabria; Our minister of war announced the following morning that he planned to depart for Calabria to defeat Garibaldi and retake Reggio, but then changed his mind that same afternoon due to considerations of his presence in the capital being essential to prevent disorder."
sardinia.247.a: "Naples will stand strong"
sardinia.249.t: "The Romanian Officer in Garibaldi's Army"
sardinia.249.d: "Nicolae Dunca, previously an officer in the Romanian army under Alexandru Ioan Cuza, has made a name for himself within the Expedition of the Thousand. Due to his extensive knowledge of Hungarian, Dunca had joined the Hungarion legion commanded by Figyelmessy and sailed with the original thousand towards Sicily. After the Battle of Volturno, Garibaldi took notice of the skill of the young officer and promoted him to a cavalry captain."
sardinia.249.a: "He makes us proud"
sardinia.249.b: "His story is one of many"
sardinia.253.t: "The Protectorate of Monaco"
sardinia.253.d: "The Congress of Vienna had transferred the protection of Monaco from the French to Piedmont via the Treaty of Stupinigi, as well as full dominion over the state. The treaty states, “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon in negotiations despite an uneven relationship between our king and the King of Monaco. With the people, we are feared, as we have sent many garrisons to destabilize and annex parts of the Principality."
sardinia.253.a: "More things to handle..."
sardinia.254.t: "Long Live Italia!"
sardinia.254.d: "Traveler and influential writer, Maxime Du Camp has written many wondrous novels of his times in Italy, including his participation in Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand. Maxime writes of hearing the loud crowds of Naples, following the plebiscites, shouting, “Long live Italy!” Afterwards, many members of the crowd asked him what “Italy'' was, as Italy had been nothing more than a geographical region after the fall of the Romans and the split into a multitude of smaller Italian states. Not the mention many of the Southern Italians lack any formal education."
sardinia.254.a: "How Embarrassing"
sardinia.255.t: "Warrior Queen of the Two Sicilies"
sardinia.255.d: "The Germanic queen to Francesco II of Two Sicilies, Queen consort Maria Sophie of Bavaria, has demonstrated her valor in the heat of battle. General Garibaldi's Expedition of The Thousand has proven well for our cause in unifying Italy under one banner, but his march on Naples was obstructed by the fortress of Gaeta. In the midst of the siege, the Sicilian queen was witnessed benevolently supporting her soldiers, caring for the wounded, and even taking up arms with them. Her bravery is admired by the Piedmontese people. Regina guerriera; Warrior Queen!"
sardinia.255.a: "Though they have lost, they fought till the end"
sardinia.256.t: "October Campaign Massacre"
sardinia.256.d: "General Cialdini of the Northern Army has been advancing south for quite some time now, during his so-called October Campaign after the capture of Campania and garrisoning the two cities of Pontelandolfo and Casalduni. The murder of 45 Piedmontese garrisons angered Cialdini, causing him to single out and execute Pro-Bourbonist soldiers and civilians. What has been most embarrassing for the national government is his ruthlessness and lack of prudence in determining whether or not the victims truly supported bourbonism. A humiliation for the Italian people, murdering our own."
sardinia.256.a: "The war will be over shortly..."
sardinia.257.t: "Nizzardo-Exodus"
sardinia.257.d: "Concomitantly and following the annexation of Nice and its surroundings from the Kingdom of Sardinia to France, in application of the agreements signed between the governments of our two countries during the Second Italian War of Independence. It has become an evident consequence, that an estimated quarter of the Nizzardi population in Nice, especially those of higher class stature have relocated to many Piedmontese towns and communes. While French authorities have dismissed the mass-migration as primarily an issue of retaining Sardinian citizenship, educated classes across Europe can evidently infer the migrations are a direct ramification of forced Francization favored and imposed by French authorities in the region. The rapid abandonment of the native-Italian region is surely a symbolic milestone in the erasure and demographic acclimatization of the historic expanse. Opposition to the French Authority is steadily on the rise after initial street skirmishes with French law enforcement."
sardinia.257.a: "A price needed to be paid..."
sardinia.258.t: "Promotions in the Military"
sardinia.258.d: "As a war with Austria looms on the horizon, Victor Emmanuel and members of the military leadership have recommended promotions be handed out to officers in the army and navy who will need to adopt leadership roles in the coming wars. Many officers have proved themselves worthy of a promotion and many more may prove their worth in the upcoming war."
sardinia.258.a: "Welcome to our new Generals and Admirals"
sardinia.259.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Breaches the Western Quadrilatero"
sardinia.259.d: "The Forces of Sardinia-Piedmont have breached the western portion of the Quadrilatero. This decisive defeat on our part leaves us no choice but to go to the negotiating table before they are able to push futher into Veneto. It is unclear whether or not the Russians will immediately gain anything from the peace but rumors have spread that a European Conference will deterimine the fate of Galicia following the end of the war."
sardinia.259.a: "This is a great shame"
sardinia.260.t: "Russia Captures Major Towns of Galicia"
sardinia.260.d: "The Russians have captured our major towns and cities of the Galicia Region. With this news, our military leaders have demanded that we negotiate a peace immediately. Allowing the Russians to push further into our lands would weaken our West for the Italians to push even further into Lombardy-Venetia. The presence of Russian troops any further inside of our territory may also inspire revolt in areas of the Empire that are not under our control."
sardinia.260.a: "We have no choice..."
sardinia.261.t: "Victory against Austria!"
sardinia.261.d: "Through the combined efforts of our forces and those of Sardinia-Piedmont, the Austrians have agreed to come to the negotiating table. Sardinia-Piedmont is leading the negotiations and rumors are spreading that a European Conference may be held to handle the future of Galicia and ensure that the Austrian Empire does not totally collapse."
sardinia.261.a: "A Great Victory!"
sardinia.262.t: "The Annexation of the Two-Sicilies"
sardinia.262.d: "The Plebiscites of the Sicilian and Neapolitan provinces have concluded. The people were asked one simple question: "Do the people want Italy, One and Indivisible, with Constitutional King Vittorio Emanuele and his legitimate descendants?" The results were overwelmingly in favor of unification and the courts of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces announced the results of the votes to cheering crowds.\n\nInteresting to note about these plebiscites is that for possibly the first time in history a woman has voted in an Italian vote. Patriot Marianna De Crescenzo was given special permission from the Electoral President to cast a ballot, and she did so to the sounds of cheers from her fellow patriots."
sardinia.262.a: "Viva L'Italia!"
sardinia.263.t: "The Procession Begins"
sardinia.263.d: "The Royal Procession for the opening of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy is about to begin. Soon Italy will be legally united as one nation. Against all odds and assumptions Sardinia-Piedmont and her people stand triumphant. Though many challenges await the new nation, this is a time of much celebration across the peninsula."
sardinia.263.a: "We must prepare"
sardinia.264.t: "Italian National Exhibition of [GetYear]"
sardinia.264.d: "Following the Unification of Italy, Victor Emmanuel and other politicians were hoping to for a show of the might of the new Italian Nation. Talented Scientist and former Finance Minister Quintino Sella commissioned the Italian National Exhibition which took place in Florence. Using the Stazione Leopolda as a base, the exhibition will run for multilpe months. Over 8,000 exhibitors are expected to show off the best of the best Italy has to offer in the fields of the arts, sciences, agriculture, and Italian industries. Most impressive so far has been the display from the agriculture field and the magnificant gardens put forward by some of those benefactories."
sardinia.264.a: "What a great showcase of the Italian Nation!"
sardinia.266.t: "Austria Demands Demobilization!"
sardinia.266.d: "§O[AUS.GetNameWithFlag]§!, fearful of our troop movements on the border of §O[LVN.GetNameWithFlag]§!, has demanded that we demobilize immediately or face war. This only fuels the fire of Risorgimento more, and with §3[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! on our side, it seems that Austrian defeat is all but certain in a war against them."
sardinia.266.a: "Stand our ground."



sardinia_news.21.t: "The Failure of the Pisacane Expedition"
sardinia_news.21.d: "Carlo Pisacane, along with his band of Sicilian political prisoners and petty theives, has parished following his attempted expedition into Sapri in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Pisacane was though to have been working with Mazzinian circles to attempt to invoke an insurrection against the Bourbon monarchy in the Two Sicilies. The local peasants had been warned ahead of time of the expedition and were told that the members were raiders looking to pillage the local towns. Thanks to the propaganda from the Bourbon authorities, Pisacane and his band were immediately attached by the locals. Despite being able to flee the initial attack, Pisacane and his remaining band were brutally slaughtered by local militia and peasants just days later, with some reports even claiming that cannabilism and other wicked activities were done to members of the expedition.\n     Following the expedition, pro-Mazzini riots broke out in Genoa and Florence before supporters were arrested. In Piedmont, supporters of the plot are rumored to be facing charges that could lead to their exile to England."

# state names event
sardinia.11.t: "State Names: English, Regional Dialects, or Italian?"
sardinia.11.d: "This mod gives you the option to play with Italian names for victory-points within Italian territories. Do you want to enable this? For immersion purposes, enabling the regional dialects is highly encouraged! If enabled, all VP’s will appear under their regional dialect denominations, with further decisions upon unification to standardize the Italian language across the peninsula, in part, changing the names of cities. You should be warned that these “dialects” for most of history have been considered languages of their own, and in some instances can vastly differ from their modern designations."
sardinia.11.a: "I want the Italian Names."
sardinia.11.b: "Yes I want the Regional Dialect names!"
sardinia.11.c: "No, keep it in English."

POLITICS_Camillo_Benso_di_Cavour_DESC: "Genevan by birth, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperiled the possessions of the Cavours because of their close ties with the Ancien Régime, but Camillo's father reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, Prince of Savoy. \n\n His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy's uniform he was obliged to wear created controversy and confirmed the growing suspicions of rebellious intent within the young Camillo. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. His father got him appointed mayor of a village south of Turin. Social interests began to absorb him; the problems of poverty and prisoner education became the subjects of his research. In 1834, he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the 'Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws.' A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 in Turin.\n\n His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the Third Legislature, he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. In October 1850, he was offered the post of Minister of Agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War, with the combined efforts of France, Great Britain, and Piedmont to secure the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire against the encroaching Russian Empire.\n\n Cavour advocates a complete anti-Austrian movement across the Piedmontese lands to fulfill the Risorgimento and unite the Italian lands, a promise he is willing to keep."

It was no secret that many within Italy considered Rome to be the rightful capital of the nation. This dilemma has been referred to as the "Roman Question" and apparently Europe has her answer. Through an impressive feat of diplomacy, an agreement has been reached in which the French garrison will leave the Papal lands and Latium as well as Rome will be transferred to the Kingdom of Italy. The Catholic Church and the Pope will maintain personal sovereignty over Rome and will continue to function independent within an area of Rome known as the Vatican. This diplomatic answer comes as a surprise to many who assumed that conflict was the only possible solution to this problem."

The expectation has been that due to the popularity and limited voting rights within Italy, Camillo Benso and his government will easily gain the majority of the House. Despite this assumption, there are many political leaders on the left who have favor among the people of Italy. Many wait to hear the results as the King prepares to inaugurate the new Parliament."

The law gave the state the right and duty to intervene in school matters, challenging the long standing tradition of Catholic Church schooling within Italy.

Out of fear for how the Republicans within the army may behave if the army was brought North, Cavour has ordered the dissolution of the army with severance for the soldiers.

Having been battling an illness for quite some time, Count Cavour had been retired to his bedside for quite some time. His death is being attributed to various complications with malaria that the Count had experienced since his childhood in the family rice fields in Vercelli.\n\n Despite having been excommunicated in 1855 and never retracting his anticlerical choices, Father Giacomo from Santa Maria adminstered confession and administered the anoiting of the sick. Cavour apparently told his trusted friend Luigi Carlo Farini that he desired for the people of Turin to know that he was dying as a good Christian."

Did your Majesty receive the letter you were expecting from Paris? The Emperor is very good to us now, yes, very good. And our poor Neapolitans so smart! There are some who have a lot of ingenuity, but there are also some who are very corrupt. These must be washed. Sire, yes, yes, wash, wash! No state of siege, no means of absolute government. Everyone is good at governing with the state of siege [... ] Garibaldi is a gentleman, I do not want any harm. He wants to go to Rome and Venice, and so do I: no one is in a hurry more than us.

Now that Italy is one state, the Right has begun the process to close these barriers. Many on the left decry that this move is premature, as Italy currently lacks a unified currency and a proper structure of trade has not been setup between the regions of Italy. Whether premature or not, the move is already done."

ita.13.t: "Reorganization of the Army"
ita.13.d: "Over the last few years the Sardinian Army has been going through great organizational changes as the armies of the old nations of the Italian Peninsula join our ranks.

ita.14.d: "King Victor Emmaneul has entrusted Bettino Ricasoli with forming a new government following the passing of Camillo Benso. The politician from Tuscany quickly became well established with the Count of Cavour and worked with him throughout unification within Tuscany. Following the annexation of Tuscany into Sardinia-Piedmont, Ricasoli was given a prominent position within the interior ministry. The King continues Cavour's trust for Ricasoli into this new government as many issues plague the Italian state."

ita.15.t: "Signing of the Pepoli Law"
ita.15.d: "The Pepoli Law has officially been signed into action today, marking a great shift in the future of the Italian Economy and Banking. The law extends the lira of the Kingdom of Sardinia, now the Italian Lira, across the entire peninsula. It also states that all circulation of pre-unification currencies must stop by the end of the year. This is just one part of the movement towards Piedmontization which strenghtens the Piedmontese politicians and holdings while threatening the economies of the South."
ita.15.a: "One Italy Requires One Currency"
ita.16.t: "Ricasoli Offers His Resignation"
ita.16.d: "Dissensions within the government have reached a boiling point for Prime Minister Ricasoli. The Iron Baron has been tormented by dissent formented by Minister Cordova and many of his cabinet have offered their resignation. The King, indisposed by poor health, recieved a letter from the Prime Minister in which Ricasoli expects "that Vittorio Emanuele and the King deign to have him freedom, peace, and rest." Victor Emmanuel is expected to accept the resignation of Ricasoli momentarily."
ita.16.a: "The Iron Baron Gave us his Best"
ita.17.t: "Formation of the Rattazzi Government"
ita.17.d: "Following the resignation of Baron Ricasoli, Urbano Rattazzi has been called upon to form a new government in Italy. His cabinet is formed almost entirely of Piedmontese politicians, and contains many independents close to the left. Prior to Cavour's death, Rattazzi had a massive break with the Count but became close to King Victor Emmanuel. The main issue for Rattazzi, it seems, is the Italian lands still under foreign control."
ita.17.a: "May the Rattazzi Government be a Strong One"
ita.18.t: "Foreign Policy in the Kingdom of Italy"
ita.18.d: "The newborn Kingdom of Italy has many concerns in foreign policy. First and foremost, is the need for diplomatic recognition of the Kingdom of Italy. We will need more nations to recognize our new state in order to take our place among the powers of Europe. The Roman Question has also caused a great stir in the parliament. Diplomacy seems to be the most popular avenue for securing the Italian lands not yet under our control, especially Rome."
ita.18.a: "There is Much to be Done"
ita.19.t: "Recognition from France"
ita.19.d: "Ever since our intervention in the Crimean War, France has served as a close ally to our cause. The influence of Count Nigra in both of our courts and the shared intrigued between our nations has made us very close. It is only naturally, then, that we should ask the French to formally recognize the Kingdom of Italy."
ita.19.a: "May our Friendship Continue"
ita.20.t: "Italy Seeks our Recognition"
ita.20.d: "The newly formed Kingdom of Italy has requested that we formally recognize their new nation. Sardinia-Piedmont long served as a diplomatic ally of ours since they joined the coalition against Russia in the Crimean War. It is only natural that we be the first major nation to recognize their nation, as it would be senseless to pretend that a divided Italy is possible in our future."
ita.20.a: "May our Friendship with Italy Continue!"
ita.21.t: "French Recognition"
ita.21.d: "Our Friends to our West have become the first nation to formally recognize us as the Kingdom of Italy. Soon to follow will be the rest of Europe, and the greater world!"
ita.21.a: "A Great Start to Italian Foreign Policy"
ita.22.t: "The Roman Question"
ita.22.d: "In his first speech to the Chamber of Deputies, Cavour has called for the Roman Question to be solved. In his speech the Count recognized the lack of Rome and Lazio from the lands of the Kingdom of Italy. In his conclusion he stated that Rome "is the necessary capital of Italy, because without Rome being united with Italy as its capital, Italy could not have a definitive order." The Catholic Church within the Kingdom of Italy has already faced tough laws from the political camp of Cavour, though it seems diplomacy will be the Count's favored method to gaining hold of Rome."
ita.22.a: "This Question Must be Resolved"
ita.23.t: "Free Church in a Free State"
ita.23.d: "In a Speech on the Roman Question Cavour has used the phrase "Free Church in a Free State" in relation to what he thinks the position of the Catholic Church should be within Italy. This statement directly challenges the Temporal power of the Pope, who has been an integral figure in Italian politics for centuries. Following his speech a warning was sent to Pope Pius that read "Holy Father, temporal power for you is no longer a guarantee of independence.""
ita.23.a: "The Church is Weakening"
ita.24.t: "Warning from the Kingdom of Italy"
ita.24.d: "A warning was recieved today from Camillo Benso that directly threatened our nation's independence. Following a speech in which Count Cavour called for a "Free Church in a Free State," a warning was sent to our diplomats that read "Holy Father, temporal power for you is no longer a guarentee of independence." This is an outrageous offence from the new Kingdom of Italy and a direct attack against our Church."
ita.24.a: "We Cannot Allow This to Stand"
ita.25.t: "A Reconciliation Project with Rome"
ita.25.d: "Ricasoli has inherited quite the mess in regards to foreign policy. Cavour was in the midsts of negotiating a deal with France and the Papal States that could have led to the annexation of Rome if not for his sudden death. It is the hopes of the government that these plans could be salvaged."
ita.25.a: "We must try"
ita.26.t: "Italy Proposes Meeting on the Papal States"
ita.26.d: "The new Prime Minister of Italy - Bettino Ricasoli - is hoping to have a meeting in Paris in order to discuss the future of the Papal States. Ricasoli takes over this position from Cavour, whose untimely death interrupted prior talks on the future of Rome. Our position as the protectors of Rome and the Papal States means we must weigh this proposal very seriously."
ita.26.a: "We Should Allow this Meeting"
ita.26.b: "We Cannot Allow this Meeting"
ita.27.t: "Italy Proposes Meeting in Paris on the Future of Rome"
ita.27.d: "It is no secret that the Kingdom of Italy has aspirations to bring Lazio and Rome into their lands. New Prime Minister of Italy Bettino Ricasoli has proposed that our nations, and our French protectors, meet in Paris to talk on the future of Rome. While the Pontificate has been rash when dealing with the Italians in diplomacy, our French protectors have already agreed to this meeting and resisting could upset them."
ita.27.a: "This Meeting Could be Beneficial"
ita.27.b: "The Very Idea is an Insult!"
ita.28.t: "War Again?"
ita.28.d: "With Prussia at war with Austria the opportunity for further expansion to liberate Italian lands is upon us. The people of Italy are not yet fully united and our independence fight is not yet won. It comes time to show our strength as a nation in Europe and we will dominate!"
ita.28.a: "To War!"
ita.29.t: "France Declines a Meeting on Rome"
ita.29.d: "The French have declined to host a meeting on the future of the Papal State in Paris. For reasons likely relating to their current status of the protector of the Papal State, the French have not shown any interest to continue the talks first started by Cavour. This is a great setback for the hope to solve the Roman Question with diplomacy."
ita.29.a: "This is Very Unfortunate"
ita.30.t: "Peace"
ita.30.d: "Following hard fought battles in lands wrongfully occupied by the Austrian Empire we have finally secured enough land and victories to consider bringing demands to the peace table. Our government is not enough radical to push for support to seek out a longer war at the risk of Prussia exiting the war before us, and leaving us to face the Austrian menace alone."
ita.31.t: "The Papal States Refuse to Meet in Paris"
ita.31.d: "Our delegates have informed us that the Papal States' diplomats are reluctant to attend a meeting on the existance of their state in Paris, finding the very idea insulting. While some believe we should respect the wishes of the Pope, others have relayed that not hearing the Italian proposal could simply be delaying the inevitable. We could still hear the Italian proposal without the Papal delegates in attendance."
ita.31.a: "There is no Point in Delaying the Issue"
ita.31.b: "Without the Support of the Pope, We Cannot Pursue This"
ita.32.t: "The Papal States Refuse to Meet in Paris"
ita.32.d: "The French delegates have informed us that the Papal States will not be sending a delegation to Paris to discuss the Roman Question. Despite this setback, the French are still willing to hear our proposal. If we play our cards right we may be able to still find a deal that will bring Rome into the Italian fold, despite the Papal stubbornness."
ita.32.a: "Unfortunate, but Acceptable"
ita.33.t: "Our Proposal on the Roman Question"
ita.33.d: "Our proposal that should be made in Paris on Rome must be well thought out before finalized. The removal of the French garrison from the Papal States and the subsequent annexation of Rome into the Kingdom of Italy is the necessary result of our proposal. Continuing from the work of Cavour, the ministers have recommended that we offer, in return for the annexation of the lands into Italy, that the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While a sound proposal to many, King Vittorio Emanuele II has recently started advocating for putting the Roman Question aside in favor of focusing on Veneto - meaning we must complete these talks sooner rather than later."
ita.33.a: "We Must Present the Proposal as it is"
ita.34.t: "The Italian Proposal on Rome"
ita.34.d: "The Italians have presented their proposal so solve the so-called Roman Question. Their proposal, in return for the annexation of the lands of the Papal States into Italy, is that the the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. Our ministers are somewhat split on the proposal. While it would maintain the power of the Pope over parts of Rome and allow the Church to still have global outreach, many fear that this could weaken Catholic resolve around the world."
ita.34.a: "We Can Accept This Proposal"
ita.34.b: "We Can Accept This Proposal"
ita.34.c: "We Cannot Accept This Proposal"
ita.35.t: "The French Accept the Italian Proposal"
ita.35.d: "During the meeting in Paris on the future of the Papal States with the new Kingdom of Italy, the French have seemingly accepted the Italian proposal. The Italian proposal, in return for the annexation of Papal lands into Italy, is that the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While certainly not a proposal any in the Church are wanting to accept, there are some gaurentees within here that solidfy the Church would remain somewhat influential in Europe. With the French having already accepted this proposal, it is unlikely we can avoid losing our lands."
ita.35.a: "We Have to Accept"
ita.35.b: "We Simply Cannot Accept This"
ita.36.t: "The Italian Proposal"
ita.36.d: "Despite our French protectors not wishing to be involved, our meeting with the Italian delegates has begun. Their proposal, to solve the infamous Roman Question, is that, in return for the annexation of our lands into Italy, the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While certainly not a proposal any in the Church are wanting to accept, there are some gaurentees within here that solidfy the Church would remain somewhat influential in Europe."
ita.36.a: "In Order to Secure our Future, We Accept"
ita.36.b: "We Cannot Accept This"
ita.37.t: "The French Decline the Italian Proposal"
ita.37.d: "During the meeting in Paris between delegates from France, Italy, and our own Papal States, the French have seemed to decline the possibility of the Italian Proposal. The Italian Proposal was that in exchange for the annexation of our lands into the Kingdom of Italy the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While certainly not a proposal any in the Church are wanting to accept, there are some gaurentees within here that solidfy the Church would remain somewhat influential in Europe. Given the French have declined this proposal we can safely also decline it. However, some within the Church believe that declining will only leave this problem to be solved within the next few years, possibly through war."
ita.37.a: "We Will Not Accept"
ita.37.b: "Despite the French, We Must Accept This"
ita.38.t: "The Papal States Accept the Proposal"
ita.38.d: "After hearing that we had accepted the Italian proposal on the future of the Roman Question, the Papal States have notified us that they are willing to accept the Italian proposal. While certainly not a day of celebration, many of our ministers are hopeful that this will help build a strong alliance between Italy, France, and the Catholic Church. We must now prepare to remove our garrisons from the Papal States as the transfer of lands begins."
ita.38.a: "May This be the Start of Something Grand"
ita.39.t: "The Proposal Has Been Accepted"
ita.39.d: "Despite the surprise by many of the ministers, and King Victor Emmanuel himself, Ricasoli's proposal on the Roman Question has been accepted by the Papal States and France. The French have already made the preparations to remove their garrisons from the Papal States and soon enough the official transfer of the land will begin. The people of Italy can celebrate now that our nation will have Rome as its rightful capital soon enough."
ita.39.a: "This is Wonderful!"
ita.40.t: "Papal States Refuse Proposal from Italy"
ita.40.d: "Despite our delegates having already accepted it, the Papal States have refused to codify the Italian proposal. Our garrisons have already been ordered to prepare to exit the Papal States and the Italians will expect that we stick to the deal. The Papal States may put up some resistance, but it is unlikely they will hold out against the Italians.

We will have to begin the process of moving our garrisons out of the Papal States to allow the transfer of land to conclude and ensure the deal is able to go on."
ita.43.a: "This is a Surprising Result"
ita.44.t: "The Papal States Decline our Proposal"
ita.44.d: "Despite our best efforts it seems Ricasoli will have to give up on solving the Roman Question for now. The attempts to find a diplomatic solution to the question of Rome have yielded no results and King Victor Emmaneul has become very displeased with what he now considers a waste of time. He has now demanded we turn our attention to Venice instead."

Garibaldi, distressed by the fact that his troops had dwindled from 2,000 to just over 1,000, ordered his own men to cease fire as to not fire upon their brothers. However, the center led by Menotti, mostly of young volunteers, charged the Bersaglieri and initially pushed them back. Garibaldi, caught between the two firing lines, received two rifle bullets, in the left hip and in the right malleolus. When the general fell the volunteers retreated to the forest while officers tended to Garibaldi. Colonel Pallavicini and his officers approached Garibaldi and asked for his surrender. Seeing former officers that he had fought along side with him just years before, Garibaldi was inclined to surrender and was arrested."

ita.50.d: "With the American Civil War going on and our nation being newly united our government faces a tough decision. The Confederate States would seek to use our ports as a place for their ships to dock and repair away from the eyes of the Union. The Union will seek to have our guarantee that the Confederates will not have this right and we would not recognize them as a legitimate state.

ita.52.t: "Italy Offers Docking Rights"
ita.52.d: "The question of where our navy might be safe to travel has been hard to find an answer for, until now. In a surprising turn of events the new Italian State has foreignd the rights for our ships to enter their long coastline and dock when needed whether under chase of the Union navy, or heavy weather. This could be a major breakthrough in getting major European nations to recognize our state as a legitimate one."

This has caused a rumor to spread that a Rattazzi-Farini-Minghetti-Peruzzi government may be prepared. However, the reality is that Rattazzi is desperately trying to strengthen his government. Some ministers, especially from the left, have been suggesting an agenda of no confidence may be in the cards soon."

ita.55.a: "Time is of the Essence"
ita.56.t: "The Southern Question"
ita.56.d: "With a newly unified Italy many new problems arise. One of these is the difference in economic development between northern and southern Italy. Another problem notable to the south are roaming brigands terrorizing the countryside, looting towns and villages and attacking Italian authorities. These problems were less noticeable when they were divided along the border of a country. But now, with that border broken down, an answer to the Southern Question must come from the combined will of everyone on the Italian peninsula, not just those in the south."

If we want to end the Pope's temporal reign, we need to first convince France to remove their garrisons from the Papal States.

A day later, before his army could be reunited, Bersaglieri from the Italian army attacked the camp. This resulted in a short battle that ended with 12 dead and 43 injured across both sides. This has forced Rattazzi to resign his position as prime minister of Italy. Farini is planned to take power in his place."

ita.61.t: "Farini Demands the King Declare War on Russia"
ita.61.d: "In response to the violent suppression of the Polish revolution in Russia by the kremlin, an angered Farini demands that the king of Italy declare war on Russia for this. While he obviously did not heed this request, this was contrary to the urges caused due to the knife he was being threatened with by Farini. This has been a great embarrasment to the Farini government, and may lead to a resignation in the near future."
ita.61.a: "That was an Overreaction"
ita.62.t: "Farini Resigns"

This protest ended in violence with carabinieri defending the building. A similar event happpened the next day at the Piazza San Carlo. Over these two days, many demonstrators were beaten, shot, injured, and murdered by Italian authorities. This incident persuaded the king to commission a new government to be formed by La Marmora, under the Royal Italian Army."

ita_news.4.d: "Prime Minister Camillo Benso, count di Cavour, and the coined father of the unified Italian nation and its people has passed away at the Palazzo Benso di Cavour Turin. The Count of Cavour was an acclaimed figure throughout Europe and the wider world for pushing the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont towards a more offensive standpoint in European politics for the last decade. Benso's notorious efforts to include the kingdom into European politics came to fruition with the subsequent arrival of the Crimean War between the Russians and a unified force of Britain, France, and Piedmont-Sardinia. While their participation came to be seen as morally just, the true purpose was to allow the suggestion of a unified Italian peninsula at the peace discussions. More recently, Cavour has navigated European diplomacy to secure alliances for the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, allowing for the conquest of the rest of the Italian Peninsula; the defeat of the Austrian Empire; and the political unification and alliances made to further Italian unification. \n\n The whole of Europe now joins the Italian Peninsula in its deep anguish as it stops its celebrations to lament the passing of a great leader—the father of unified Italy."

This was due to a clause in the September Convention, an agreement between Italy and France. It is not yet known how this will affect Italy moving forward."

ITA_PIE_focus_Approach_our_Old_Enemies_desc: "Approachment with Austria would be a strange choice at this time, however it may lead to a diplomatic path towards the annexation of Venetia. This is no guarantee, of course.\n\n§RThis path is currently a WIP and non-functional. It may be added in a future update.§"

ITA_PIE_focus_An_Exchange_of_Territory_desc: "With our reapproachment with Austria, they may be willing to exchange Venetia for Sardinia. While we value Sardinia being a part of Italy, we feel that Venetia is more important to us, but not worth going through a war with a great power for."

ITA_PIE_focus_The_Left_Coalition_desc: "The spirit of 1848 shows it is still strong among the population with this result.

A brilliant statesman and former Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia has his work cut out for him. One of the main issues is the location of the new nation’s capital. Many Italians want that to be Rome, but that would put Italy on a collision course with the Papal States. The new Prime Minister will have to tread carefully."
ITA_PIE_focus_Organization_New_State: "Organization of the New State"
ITA_PIE_focus_Organization_New_State_desc: "Creating a unified Italy out of several Kingdoms creates its own problems.

ITA_PIE_focus_Bring_Leftist_Policies_Parliament_desc: "It wasn’t just the great statesmen of Italy that were behind the unification and independence wars. Without the common people taking up arms and fight on the frontline those statesmen wouldn’t have succeeded. It is time that the common man receives the fruits of their sacrifices and hard work. Fair labour laws, fair elections, equality are the new words of the days."
ITA_PIE_focus_Piedmontization: "Piedmontization"
ITA_PIE_focus_Piedmontization_desc: "The first Italian elections were held according to the election laws of Piedmont-Sardinia.

ITA_PIE_focus_Fiscal_Consolidation: "Fiscal Consolidation"
ITA_PIE_focus_Fiscal_Consolidation_desc: "Italy didn’t only inherit the different kingdoms militaries, judicial institutions and political and administrative systems, it also inherited the former kingdoms debts.

ITA_PIE_focus_Close_Custom_Barriers: "Close Custom Barriers"

ITA_PIE_focus_Arrests_in_Trentino_desc: "Garibaldi, his supporters in the Action Party, and other radical populations have organised in Trentino to proclaim their support of Garibaldi in his fight against the Austrians and Romans.

ITA_PIE_focus_Lanza_Law_desc: "Marmora feels it is time to make clear our intentions on Rome. While we agreed to respect the pope's independence, we can no longer hold this promise as we now declare we have full reign to take Rome in whatever manner we see fit."
ITA_PIE_focus_Move_Chamber_to_Florence: "Move the Chamber to Florence"
ITA_PIE_focus_Move_Chamber_to_Florence_desc: "Turin, historically the capital of Sardinia-Piedmonte, can no longer serve as the capital of Italy.
