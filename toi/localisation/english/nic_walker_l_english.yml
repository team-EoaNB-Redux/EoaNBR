###Events
nic.8.t: "The Nicaraguan Democrats"
nic.8.d: "During our initial occupation of Nicaragua, we allied with the Nicaraguan Democrats, helping them overthrow their conservative enemies, with whom they had long struggled, without either side gaining a decisive advantage. Their support was valuable during the first half of our previous expedition, however after our botched attempt to gain legitimacy through elections, many including President Rivas defected to the enemy. Now, though some are collaborating, most major figures have taken arms against us. While this may seem to be unsolvable, some may be willing to compromise, such as Maximo Jerez, who was formerly our foreign minister and was exiled to a post in Nicaragua by Tomas Martinez, conservative junta leader. However, we may also decide to rely purely on our own manpower and eschew the help of these traitors"

nic_walker.7.t: "Publishing of 'The War in Nicaragua'"
nic_walker.7.d: "The Infamous Filibuster, William Walker, has published a book on the nicuaragua war from his perspective. The Book details the initial intervention of Walker into the Civil war between the local Democratic party and the Legitimists. however once Walker took the Nicaraguan capital of Granada he set himself up as the de facto leader. Walker then attempted to enforce Southern American culture onto the country. There was a attempt to send peaceful overtures to the other central american nations, but while this was being sort walker began talking about further military conquests. The President of Costa Rica, Juan Rafael Mora, rejected these false offers of peace and declared war, defeating the army Walker sent to deal with them. Costa Rica then lead a Alliance of all the other Central American countries to drive Walker out of Nicaragua. Walker ends the book blaming the US navy for his defeat."
