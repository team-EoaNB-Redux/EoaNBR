 AUS_Compromise_Achieved: "The Compromise Achieved"
 AUS_Compromise_Achieved_desc: "Due to the handling of the situation, Franz Joseph managed to stop further unrest from plauging the already exhuasted empire. However, a compromise was founded in these hard times, which, for the better or worse, has established Hungary as a equal of Austria, with Franz Joseph now reining as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary respectively.\n\nReactions are mixed within the Dual Monarchy, but one thing is sure: Austria, Hungary and their loyal subjects will advance together in these hard times."

 AUS_HUN_December_Constitution: "The December Constitution "
 AUS_HUN_December_Constitution_desc: "It is no secret that the empire has, under some unfortunate circumstances, been forced to adapt. However, we must make with what we have, and as per the requests of the Liberal faction, we have begun to establish a new constitution. While some might protest the decision, Franz Joseph is forced to limit his power, or risk backlash from the rapidly rising Liberals.\n\nHow we handle the creation of it is up to us, but we will need to allow for equality between all the minorities to be established, and the creation of somewhat autonomous entities. Furthermore, the Imperial Council shall take up some duties from Franz Joseph, slowly abolishing the Autocracy of our nation."
 AUS_HUN_Bourgeois_Cabinet: "The Bourgeois Cabinet"
 AUS_HUN_Bourgeois_Cabinet_desc: "With the establishment of the December constitution, which saw many Liberal reforms enacted, the popularity of the Liberal faction within the Imperial government has rapidly expanded, and it seems as if the days of the Aristocratic cabinet is numbered. While Franz-Joseph is not supportive of the Reformists, it would be best to promote progressivism, and to advance our society forward.\n\nCount Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, along with several other Liberals, Reformists and Progressives, are to form a new cabinet to stabilize the situation of the Dual-Monarchy."
 AUS_HUN_Abrogate_Concordat: "Abrogate the Concordat"
 AUS_HUN_Abrogate_Concordat_desc: "The Concordat of 1855 during its implementation was relatively popular, marking reconciliation with the Catholic church, and letting said church sway power over Marriages, Censorship and Education. While it may have served the interests of the Clergy and Absolutists, it certainly did not of the average citizen of the Empire.\n\nAs the Dual-Monarchy is slowly turning more reformist, we come to the issue of the Concordat. While some of its laws could be intergrated into the December Constitution, it as a concept will be abolished. This will also see the implementation of eventual Secular Education and the restoration of Civil Marriages."

 AUS_HUN_Electoral_Reform_1: "Electoral Reform in Cisleithania "
 AUS_HUN_Electoral_Reform_1_desc: "With the ratification of the December constituion and the Imperial Cabinet empowered a long discussed topic comes into our eye, that being elections. While we are no stranger to such, it has usually been only between the Aristocracy, Imperial Council and Emperor. Democracy is a foreign concept to the Dual-Monarchies, and while we wont empower the lower-class just yet, we will begin to reform the electoral system of the Austrian crownlands, Cisleithania.\n\nWhile the House of Lords has been extended into the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, that being the Hungarian monarchy, Austria's rising liberalization has marked the call for a more fairer electoral system. The Bourgeoisie, or middle class, will be allowed to partake in elections issued in Cisleithania, as promised by the Augsleich compromise. For now, the Austrian half will experiment the concept of a contained democracy."

 AUS_HUN_Galician_Sejm_desc: "While many would like to see the abolishment of Habsburg authority in the Dual-Monarchy, there still remain some ethnicities loyal to us. The Polish, mostly within the Governorate of Galicia-Lodomeria have proved themselves loyal to far, and remain a royalist stronghold. Such loyalty cannot go unnoticed, and with the Liberals establishing their own cabinet, we will take up action to reward our subjects.\n\nThe Polish are to be given self-governance to establish the Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria, which will act similar to the Hungarians, albeit remaining under the Austrian empire. A regional parliament, known as 'Sejm' will be established, to take up concerns of the Polish regions and put them forward to Vienna."

 AUS_HUN_United_Economy_desc: "The Austrian economy was some 100 years ago the most dominant within the Germanic sphere. While the economy did experience a brief rise in between the Austro-Sardinian war and Second Schelswig war, our distastorous defeat against the inferior Northern Germans has scared not only the military, but also the economy.\n\nIn order to recover from the loss of the German Confederation, we will need to rapidly modernize and industrialize our nation. The Austro-Hungarian economy is currently a decentralized powderkeg, and we will need to renovate the system within the forseeable future, if we do not want to throw the Habsburgs into their deathbed."

 AUS_HUN_Rapid_Industrialisation_desc: "While Austria-Hungary currently has seen a reliable, albeit lackluster growth via trade and agriculture which cannot continue. The vast nations of America, Britain and France all acheived their sizeable economies via industrialization. While the Austrian-half of the empire has seen some establishment of manufactoriers in Prag and Wien, we will need to expand our projects of industrialization to Galicia, Illyria and Hungary. Similar to a human body, all organs need to work in unison for their survival, we all need to aid each other in this.\n\nWe will use our vast treasury to subsidize German and Hungarian corporations and businesses, and also begin to construct state-directed factoriers within major urban centers, to also kickstart urbanization, which will eventually see us rivaling the other industrial powerhouses."

 AUS_HUN_Albrecht_conservative_army: "Archduke Albrecht's Conservative Army"
 AUS_HUN_Albrecht_conservative_army_desc: "Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen and Cousin of the Emperor, a staunch conservative, seeks to implement a Prussian-style army reform. A devoted believer in disciplined, top-down, and centralized hierarchies, he is, however, also very skeptical of technology and innovation. Other plans of his include the intensification of drills and the strengthening of the loyalty to the crown and emperor."
 AUS_HUN_Responsibility_in_war: "Study Responsibility in War"
 AUS_HUN_Responsibility_in_war_desc: "In alignment with Albrecht’s conservative views, we need to increase the responsibility of officers and soldiers in the happenings of war. Never again can the devastating events of the Napoleonic wars be allowed to happen. A clearly defined hierarchy, with reasonably assigned tasks, will turn our divisions into cohesive units, able to withstand enemy attacks without needless loss of morale or organization."
 AUS_HUN_Functional_army: "A Functional Army"
 AUS_HUN_Functional_army_desc: "While bureaucracy is important, it shouldn’t impede the smooth operation of the army. We need to be able to dynamically train, coordinate, and organize divisions while remaining flexible enough to adjust for contingencies on the battlefield. Our enemies will not wait, shall we get bogged down in complications, so let us prevent these from ever occurring. An efficient army is an effective army."
 AUS_HUN_Napoleon_thoughts: "Adapt Napoleonic Thoughts"
 AUS_HUN_Napoleon_thoughts_desc: "A central part of Napoleonic warfare was the integration, professionalization, and flexibility of the army. Instead of a decentralized, haphazard group of individuals, we need to combine all elements into a singular, corporatist whole. Our divisions need to be able to respond to changes quickly and coordinatedly without losing morale or order. Combined with an introduction of new tactics, this reform will wake the army out of its slumber."
 AUS_HUN_Modern_Ancient_Uniforms: "Modern or Ancient Uniforms for the Army"
 AUS_HUN_Modern_Ancient_Uniforms_desc: "As a symbol of the new army reforms, we should also introduce a new, modern uniform. While being innovative in terms of material, comfort, and flexibility, the design itself reflects our devotion to the monarchy, as imperial symbolism remains - true to tradition. With this unified look, our divisions will be able to fight with more coherence and organization."
 AUS_HUN_Uniforms_pride: "The Uniforms are our Pride"
 AUS_HUN_Uniforms_pride_desc: "As an unexpected but welcome byproduct of the new uniforms, our soldiers fight with increased pride in their role as protectors of our empire. The cohesion of the divisions is high, owing to the sense of comradery between our men. The new uniforms don’t only serve as a tether to our tradition and history but are also extremely popular."
 AUS_HUN_Artillery_status: "Status of the Artillery"
 AUS_HUN_Artillery_status_desc: "Our artillery suffers from various problems. From logistical issues and lack of mobility to technological backwardness and untrained artillerymen, it would be an understatement to describe the situation as subpar. Thus, we need to introduce comprehensive reform to restore our might on the field and bring us up to speed with the other great powers on the continent."
 AUS_HUN_Haubitz_research: "Fund Haubitzen Research"
 AUS_HUN_Haubitz_research_desc: "We will further our research into the Haubitzen, a versatile version of artillery capable of providing cover fire from a greater range and with greater versatility. These new units will be thoroughly integrated into their respective divisions, coupled with expert training of the artillerymen operating the new machines."
 AUS_HUN_Artillerie_Division: "Form the Reitende Artilleriedivision"
 AUS_HUN_Artillerie_Division_desc: "An innovative new division termed the “Reitende Artilleriedivision” or “Mounted Artillery division” was devised by the military minds of our empire. A combination of artillery and cavalry, it emphasizes high mobility combined with strong firepower. As fast as regular cavalry units, the horse-drawn batteries can keep up with the flanks while still providing deciding strength."
 AUS_HUN_Napoleonic_legacy: "Napoleonic Legacy"
 AUS_HUN_Napoleonic_legacy_desc: "Even though Austria suffered a series of crushing defeats at the hands of Napoleon - that doesn’t mean we cannot learn from him. Especially his implementation of artillery as an independent part of the army, not just in a support role, should be emulated. Aggressive usage of artillery will give our army a significant ability for breakthroughs while also providing indispensable cover fire. Let us learn from the past so we can move forward into the future."
 AUS_HUN_mass_artillery: "En masse Artillery"
 AUS_HUN_mass_artillery_desc: "Instead of dispersed, spread-out positioning, let us introduce a more concentrated and numerous usage of artillery. This amassed firepower will be used to take down specific enemy positions and fortifications while also being able to change targets in a unified fashion. With the changing winds in mass warfare, artillery must adjust, which is what this reform seeks to achieve."
 AUS_HUN_Fieldcannon_Experts: "Field-Cannon Experts"
 AUS_HUN_Fieldcannon_Experts_desc: "As a last contribution to the innovation of artillery, Albrecht wants to increase the importance of Field-Cannon Experts. Tasked with testing new models, advising divisions, and educating soldiers, these select men will contribute to the innovation in tactics that will give us the edge on the battlefield.  These experts will even bring reports and suggestions to Albrecht himself, thus advancing the overall improvement of the army."
