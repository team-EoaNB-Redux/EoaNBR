 russia.1.d: "Your Majesty, cotton merchant Ludwig Knoop of the Free State of Bremen, has established the Krenholm Manufacturing Company, a cotton spinning and weaving mill in Estonia on the banks of the Narva River. This factory is massive and maybe the largest in the world. Employing 12,000 people, and owning 32,000 acres of land, Knoop will surely be a very powerful man, important to our economy, and it is in our best interest that we keep him on our good side."

 russia.3.d: "Our Great Nation is filled with many illiterates, especially and obviously amongst the peasents and poor.

However during the majority of Nicholas I’s rule, the Russian Imperial government lacked the funds to construct any public library whatsoever, so it was not until today that the first public library in the oblast of Ryazan was built: The Gorky Library. Being based in the populated and influential city of Gorky, it was the clear choice, having also to due with the many wealthy and educated patrons funding the project."

 russia.6.t: "Protests Against Vodka!"
 russia.6.d: "Prices for alcohol have always been relatively low in Russia since the times of Ivan IV, but over the recent years that prices increased gradually. In the 1830's to 1840's prices had risen to 2-3 rubles per bucket of vodka. This money is also a price for a calf.\nNow it became even worse, as prices for vodka have risen three times as large as they were in the 1850 year. This is because Russia needs to replenish its depleted budget after the Crimean War, but also it causes instability in our states, especially among the poor. Protests against that policy originally started in Kovno Governorate, in Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking any high-degree alcohol except for "medicinal purposes". However, wine and beer are still permitted. Locals, supported by the Catholic clergy, established chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety, a temperance society that originated in Silesia and has support from the Pope himself. That was at the end of the 1858 year\nFew months ago the situation has become even worse - peasants all around the Empire are taking oaths of abstention from vodka. Boycotts were in 91 uyezds (an area that is part of the governorate) of 32 governorates. Sales of alcohol dramatically decreased, with vodka prices dropped in 16-20 times and retailers sometimes offering vodka for free. Now members of temperance societies attack taverns and destroy alcohol stockpiles. This is going beyond the borders of good and bad..."

It slowly was boiling since the Manifesto of Emperor Alexander II from March 19, 1856, when the greater agrarian reforms were promised but the implementation was slow, and in this month peasants from the Mahtra estate in Estonia revolted against our rule! Troops were sent to bring back order..."
 russia.8.a: "What? A peasant revolt? Are we in Pugachev times again?"

 russia.9.t: "Mahtra War Ends!"
 russia.9.d: "Nearly two months ago a peasant unrest caused a rebellion against the Tsar in the Estonian governorate on the Mahtra estate. It has been handled by the regular garrison army, resulting 14 wounded and 7 casualites, with 3 of the wounded later dying from fatal wounds. A battle is not without our own loss: Our company suffered some casualties—13 wounded soldiers and 1 killed officer. 60 of 65 peasant defendants were sentenced to death by our court-martial in Tallinn, but later Baltic governor-general Suvorov reduced the sentences of 44 peasants to corporal punishment; 35 of whom were sentenced to leave to Siberia in exile; and the remaining 21 rebels released off all charges. This revolt was crushed easily by our army, but what says the next one will occur in a more densely-populated city, like Moscow. . .?"

 russia.20.d: "Since 1725, when Peter the Great installed the Soul Tax, there have been many incidents happening in the motherland: crises, wars, and industrial advancements has changed the world and Russia as well. Now the Soul Tax became mostly obsolete even in a modernized state. Hence why the government is adamantly pushing to discuss it with the respective Zemstvos of the Russian Governorates. Half support graduating from lower to higher income tax which will be levied upon all the population and will leave the tax income on state budget the same, the outcome being peasants and commoners living better in cost of nobility cash. Some other commissions supported the usual income tax, but only for merchants, and some additional taxes on the nobility and peasants. The idea barley made it through, as it was laughed at due to its ineffectiveness, with the central government shutting it down almost immediately. Finally, one more proposal: property taxes instead of both soul and income taxes. If you have much property but a low income you should sell a portion of your items to have overall lower taxes. All things will be levied with those new taxes, from spoons to great estates spanning kilometers. This is an unpopular and very untraditional proposal but it gained support through the economically competent people in our realm. Maybe we should listen to them. Or we can just drop all the initiative and suffer the consequences of an inefficient tax policy. The Nobility would be pleased with that."

 russiaalas.1.t: "The Summer Garden"
 russiaalas.1.d: "Alexander II leisurely paced through the picturesque Summer Garden, within the Palace Embankment in St. Petersburg. Flocked by a large entourage of noblemen and attendants, Alexander only found a certain amount of reprieve for himself from the crowd when he stood to gaze, captivated, upon the beauty of some of the oldest fountains to be found in all of Russia.\n\nAs the Emperor’s tour of Peter the Great’s creation drew to a close, he made his way toward the large gate that marked the entrance of the Garden, stopping to remark at its fine artistry as a crowd of onlookers began to assemble around him."
 russiaalas.1.a: "Another testament to Peter’s magnificence!"

 russiaalas.2.t: "Attempt on the Emperor's Life - Summer Garden"
 russiaalas.2.d: "Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nAlexander jolted about when he heard the discharge of the weapon. He was still alive. Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary’s attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter’s apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary’s arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. The guards wrested his weapon away from him and confiscated what appeared to be morphine and strychnine to kill himself with, along with prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him “What do you want?” The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him “Nothing, nothing,” before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students’ organization known as the Ishutin Society, led by Nikolai Ishutin. He has been locked away in the Peter and Paul Fortress awaiting his punishment, but he begs for forgiveness and even offers to convert to Orthodoxy."

 russiaalas.3.t: "Alexander II Has Been Assassinated!"
 russiaalas.3.d_1: "Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nThe beloved Emperor collapsed into the hands of his attendants as the impact of the shotgun shells ripped into his chest, spilling blood all over his uniform and the noblemen around him. The assailant ducked his weapon back into his coat and attempted to flee the scene, but was quickly accosted by the guards and taken away.\n\nAs the crowds gathered around to gaze in horror at their wounded Emperor, the guards desperately attempted to disperse the crowds as a carriage rode up to take him away to the Winter Palace. As the carriage fled the scene, the condition Alexander worsened severely, as he began to cough up blood and grow extremely pale and weak. Although the doctors attending to him tried everything in their power to stop the bleeding, the Emperor took his last breath just as his carriage screeched to a halt outside of his residence. The Tsar is no more."

 #### FOCUS

 russiavicfocus.1.t: "Germans Immigrate To The Volga Region"
 russiavicfocus.1.d: "Over the past few months, the Russian Empire has seen a substantial amount of German migrants settling in the Volga Region east of Moscow. While the Tsars and their advisors have traditionally been sceptical of foreigners immigrating into their feudal nation, as Serfdom becomes less reliable, these new Germanic vagrants could prove quite useful in developing and modernizing our nation in the coming years."
 russiavicfocus.1.a: "We shall make good use of them!"

 russiavicfocus.2.t: "The Crimean War"
 russiavicfocus.2.d: "The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain, and Sardinia. The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs. As the legend of the "Charge of the Light Brigade" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement."
 russiavicfocus.2.a: "We'll have to do something"

 russiavicfocus.3.t: "New Minister of War Appointed"
 russiavicfocus.3.d: "It wasn't a long time ago, since enemy forces invaded our motherland, the first time since the Napoleonic Wars! Our army fought bravely but this time we lost. Now we have to consider new reforms to improve it. \n\nAfter the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, the Minister of War, Count Dmitry Milyutin, (who held the post from 16 May 1861 to 21 May 1881) introduced many much-needed reforms. The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874, the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."
 russiavicfocus.3.a: "Let's hope he serves well."

 russiavicfocus.4.t: "Reign of Alexander II"
 russiavicfocus.4.d: "On September 7th, 1856 AD Tsar Alexander II was coronated at the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. A younger and more enlightened ruler, Alexander would seek to modernize Russia both economically and socially through a variety of bold reforms. He would do away with the archaic and brutal system of Serfdom in 1861, earning him the title of "The Liberator" by those he emancipated. Only time will tell if he will lead his great nation to the future, however, as the dark forces of the Imperial Court could turn him into nothing more than another regressive reactionary..."
 russiavicfocus.4.a: "Long may he reign!"

 russiavicfocus.5.t: "Michael von Reutern"
 russiavicfocus.5.d: "A skilled German economist from the Baltic duchies has emerged as a prime candidate to guide our financial policy. While not of Russian blood, Michael Von Reutern is still a cut above the other potential candidates. Now would be the ideal time to hire his services"
 russiavicfocus.5.a: "Let us Hire him immediately"

 russiavicfocus.7.a: "Absolutely!"

 russiavicfocus.8.t: "The Okhrana"
 russiavicfocus.8.d: "Following recent plots against our dearest leader and his regime, the Tsar has decided that enough is enough. From now on, the Okhrana will serve as our eyes and ears on the streets, a secret police dedicated to silence anyone and everyone who schemes against us in the shadows."
 russiavicfocus.8.a: "Death to traitors!"

 russiavicfocus.9.t: "The Imperial Security Service"
 russiavicfocus.9.d: "The borderlands of Mother Russia have grown increasingly dangerous as of late, with bandits and marauders plundering and pillaging our frontier settlements. Thus a reform of our internal security policy is necessary, one that will greatly expand its powers to a functional and professional enforcer of the law."
 russiavicfocus.9.a: "The ISS shall serve us well"

 russiavicfocus.10.t: "Russia Wants To Exchange Naval Technology"
 russiavicfocus.10.d: "We have received word from the leaders of Russia requesting an exchange of our naval development and research. While such a deal could be mutually beneficial, it carries significant security and political risks as well."

 russiavicfocus.13.a: "Damn it!"

 russiavicfocus.14.t: "Russia Supports Orthodoxy in Palestine!"
 russiavicfocus.14.d: "The Russian foreign ministry has publicly endorsed the practices of the Christian monasteries operating in the area, igniting a level of religious fervour we haven't seen in years. If this goes unchecked a massive uprising among Christians could ignite in the Levant and we'd know exactly who was responsible.."
 russiavicfocus.14.a: "Damn it!"

 russiavicfocus.15.t: "Russia Supports Irish Population"
 russiavicfocus.15.d: "In a rather surprising move from an imperialist nation known for its poor treatment of its minority groups, the Russian Foreign Ministry has announced its support for the Irish resistance against the British occupiers, clearly like a bold and brash move against its greatest rival in the Great Game."
 russiavicfocus.15.a: "Interesting..."

 russiavicfocus.16.t: "The Russian European Empire"
 russiavicfocus.16.d: "Over the past few centuries, The Russian Empire has greatly expanded its borders and during the recent major conflicts most of its gains were made in Europe. Our most westward territories are home to the Polish. A catholic nation, which isn’t afraid to fight for its independence. Their homeland is also inhabited by Germans and Jews. To the north lies Finland, a protestant country with a rising national identity. The Baltic Sea coastline is inhabited by Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, and also by Germans, which have lived here since the times of the Livonian Order. With such a diverse population we’ll have to carefully plan, actively fighting separatism and other revolutionary ideas, which seek to overthrow our just and legitimate rule."
 russiavicfocus.16.a: "For Mother Russia!"

 russiavicfocus.17.t: "Finland Integrated"
 russiavicfocus.17.d: "From now on the frontier region of Finland shall be acknowledged as a core part of the Russian nation. Once a vassal of the Swedes, no longer shall it's people be burdened by their false sense of identity and nationality."
 russiavicfocus.17.a: "They are now Russian"

 russiavicfocus.18.t: "Russia Abolished The Grand Duchy!"
 russiavicfocus.18.d: "As Finland has been incorporated firmly as a province in the core Russian state rather than a distinct nation under a personal union, the once prestigious title of the Grand Duchy of Finland is no longer necessary and will be abolished starting now"
 russiavicfocus.18.a: "Excellent!"

 russiavicfocus.19.t: "End of Russification in European Russia"
 russiavicfocus.19.d: "The once-proud peoples of Poland and Ukraine have seen the light as ethnic Russians and abandoned their old and archaic roots and past glories. No longer shall they be burdered with their own culture and language. As true Russians, they are no longer occupied peoples but rather core parts of the greatest nation on earth."
 russiavicfocus.19.a: "Wonderful!"

 russiavicfocus.20.t: "The Governor of Finland"
 russiavicfocus.20.d: "The Governor of Finland has been adept in his handling of internal affairs in the Finnic nation, but his independence and self-reliance suggest he does not respect the authority of the Tsar and his rightful rule over all of his empire. Sacking him for a replacement could prove wise to prevent separatism or calls for federalist reform but it might cause uproar or instability in the region for years to come."
 russiavicfocus.20.a: "Replace him"
 russiavicfocus.20.b: "Keep the current one"

 russiavicfocus.21.t: "Governor of Finland Replaced"
 russiavicfocus.21.d: "We have sacked the old Governor of Finland and replace him with a hand-picked appointee of the Tsar personally loyal to the Romanovs as a mere puppet. Hopefully, this will discourage Liberals and Separatists by dashing their hopes for constitutional or autonomous reform but only time shall tell."

    russiavicfocus.28.t: "Invest in Special Training for Military Railway Department?"
    russiavicfocus.28.d: "The soldiers of our recently created military railway department require special instructions for their tasks and the technical equipment they are dealing with in order to act efficiently in times of conflict. Investing into their training could certainly increase their usefulness and the reward they bring to the table. Given time, we might also benefit from the experiences we gain in the process. Should we make the necessary investments to facilitate their training?"

 russia.22.t: "Censoring 'Fathers and Sons'?"
 russia.22.d: "'Russian Bulletin' has sent its new March-April issue to the Censor Department. That would be a usual publication if it hadn't the new Turgenev's novel inside, called 'Fathers and Sons'. Its idea is rotating around nihilism, an ideology of denial of every authority and even somewhat revolutionary! It can be dangerous enough for our aristocracy which already supports liberal ideas. We can give the order - and this book will be completely different, but Turgenev will be completely disappointed in our government. He is one of the most loyal writers of our Motherland and it would be a tall loss. But what if we go soft with this novel and just let it be? Of course, there will be some mimics who will call themselves 'nihilists', but... isn't it what we want to make them think? Just ensure that they are loyal, being initiative and innovative isn't a crime in Russia."
 russia.22.a: "Let's not be strict, it's not the Nikolay era after all."
 russia.22.b: "Better censure this 'nihilism', else we can suffer from crazy idealists raised on that book..."

	russia.23.t: "Censoring 'Fathers and Sons' Revealed!"
	russia.23.d: "When the novel about Evgeniy Bazarov has just been written by Turgenev, we decided to censor it heavily, remove all questionable themes and never return to this. But due to the end of the Censor Department, following the new law about the press, the real book has been revealed! Now people are blaming us for hiding that 'masterpiece' from them. That led to us losing some positions in government and, what is worrying - 'nihilism' starts to spread through our population!"
	russia.23.a: "What a shame..."

	russia.24.t: "Publishment of 'Crime and Punishment'"
	russia.24.d: "Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a new book, called 'Crime and Punishment'. It tells about a poor Russian student, Rodion Raskolnikov, who tries to survive in Saint Petersburg and lends his old but only kettle to the old woman, who was a money lender. He says that this is unfair and kills her along with her silly-minded sister and then tries to merge his philosophy theory about 'the ones who have the right and the ones who don't' with the fact of murder. When he founds his love and starts a more active life, meeting many people, his conscience begins to rise slowly, leading him to surrendering to police and going to penal colony in Siberia. His love follows him and there he finally finds his salvation, throws out his ideas and starts a new life with his woman. This book, being published now in the 'Russian Bulletin', is close to the title of masterpiece and doesn't really tell about any political ideas, so we can just let it be."
	russia.24.a: "Worth of reading in spare time - Dostoevsky wrote a good piece!"

	russiasiberiancolonization.5.t: "'Oblastnichestvo' Rises!"
	russiasiberiancolonization.5.d: "When Siberian students named Grigory Potanin, Nikolay Yadrintsev, Serafim Shashkov, Nikolay Naumov, Fyodor Usov and other ones came to St. Petersburg in the early 60-s, they immediately created an idea of Siberian independence or 'at least' autonomy for their region. They returned home in 1863, immediately establishing contacts with political prisoners and Polish people who were exiled after their recent rebellion. They were gathering forces and money to incite revolt in Siberia, but at this summer, in the year 1865, their plot was uncovered. Forty four members of the group were arrested and taken to prison by the Russian government in May after watch officers of the Siberian Cadet Corps searched cadet Arseny Samsonov, aged 16, for illicit items and found a proclamation entitled 'To Patriots of Siberia,' attributed to collective authorship of G. Potanin, N. Yadrintsev and other leaders of the movement. Now all of them were sent to various places around the empire for either penal labour or exile, ensuring that we won't hear of them revolting again. Their ideas got some foothold within minds of local bourgeois in Tomsk, Tobolsk and Irkutsk, but that doesn't matter, because no one questions Russian authority in those lands anymore."
