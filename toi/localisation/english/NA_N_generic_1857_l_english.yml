  ### Nez Perce War ###
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.t: "Revise the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.d: "After the Orofino Creek Gold Rush, settlers flocked the Nez Perce reservation in search of riches. Due to the inability of the Federal government to stop the flocking of settlers, [NEZ.GetName] defended it's territory outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. As a consequence of neglecting the settlement crises conflicts are regular.\n\nA proposition has been made to federalize 90% of the [NEZ.GetAdjective] Reservation in an attempt to better regulate the creation of settlements. It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nThe only issue is with the [NEZ.GetName], who find this proposal to be highly controversial. The tribes are split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but they don't have much leverage in our negotiation. They have again and again asked us to uphold the territories outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1850 and to remove unlawful settlements. Though this would certainly remove our access to the rich gold mines of the [1074.GetName] Reservation.\n\nWith that in mind, one question remains... What shall we do?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.a: "Revising the treaty to federalize gold mines will better regulate settlements."
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.b: "The problem will be solved if we simply remove unlawful settlements."
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.2.t: "The Revision of the 1855 Walla Walla Treaty"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.2.d: "After the Orofino Creek Gold Rush, settlers flocked the Nez Perce reservation in search of riches. Due to the inability of the Federal government to stop the flocking of settlers, [NEZ.GetName] defended it's territory outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. As a consequence of the United States neglecting the settlement crises, conflicts became a regular occurrence.\n\nA proposition has been made to federalize 90% of the [NEZ.GetAdjective] Reservation in an attempt to better regulate the creation of settlements. It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nMany people throughout the [NEZ.GetName] find this proposal to be highly controversial. Our tribe is split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but we don't have much leverage in our negotiation. Chief Hallalhotsoot, the Lawyer Chief, negotiated the original Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. He has navigated politics to give us the best possible deal before, and has manged to secure a small portion of our original territory to stay as our own. The Lawyer Chief states that military conflict with the United States is futile, that it is best to diplomatically secure our existance.\n\nThough not all are agree with the Lawyer Chief's outlook. Some, such as Chief Joseph, resent this treaty and reject it entirely. The aftermath of this treat has divided the tribe between those who will go and those who will stay and fight."
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.2.a: "The Lawyer Chief did what he could, but we are not capitulating our land."
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.2.b: "The Lawyer Chief is weak, Chief Joseph will fight to keep our lands!"
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.3.t: "The Walla Walla Treaty Revised"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.3.d: "The signing of the new Walla Walla Treaty took place, and the new reservation borders are being recognized by those that agree with the Lawyer Chief, Chief Hallalhotsoot. Unfortunately not all share the wise insight of the Lawyer Chief, that resistance is futile, and are dead set on rejecting the treaty. Those individuals have been declared enemies of the state for not adhering to the new treaty."
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.3.a: "The Lawyer Chief made a smart decision to cooperate with us."
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.t: "The Settler Ultimatum to Nez Perce"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.d: "Settlers called a council in May and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation. The Nez Perce stress that they need enough time to move their livestock to the reservation, but settlers demand they leave within 30 days. A discussion with the non-treaty bands is expected to take place shortly. But before this meeting takes place, what should our stance be on this matter?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.a: "Thirty Days! They've had years to leave before today!"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.b: "A year would be a realistic timeframe, but we may anger settlers..."
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.6.t: "The Settler Ultimatum to Nez Perce"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.6.desc_1: "General Oliver Otis Howard called a council in May and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation, setting an impossible deadline of 30 days. Howard humiliated the Nez Perce by jailing their old leader, Toohoolhoolzote, who spoke against moving to the reservation. The other Nez Perce leaders, including Chief Joseph, considered military resistance to be futile; they agreed to the move and reported as ordered to Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory.\n\nOne of the major concerns of the leaders was that they have sufficient time to prepare to leave and to move their livestock. They wanted to wait until autumn as a minimum, or ideally, a year. Toohoolhoolzote also expressed the natives' reluctance to sell their land, which went against their religious beliefs. The military, on the other hand, demanded that they be moved in 30 days, or the soldiers would use force. General Oliver O. Howard put this to them strongly, after Toohoolhoolzote began to speak on the sacredness of the Earth to his people:\n'I do not want to hear you say anything more like that. I am telling you! Thirty days you have to get on the reservation.'\n'You ask me to talk, then tell me to say no more,' Toohoolhoolzote replied. 'I am chief! I ask no man to come and tell me anything what I must do. I am chief here!'\nGeneral Howard answered sharp. 'Yes, you are chief. I am telling you! Thirty days you have to move in... I am the man to tell you what you must do! You will come on the reservation within time I tell you. If not, soldiers will put you there or shoot you down!'\n\nToohoolhoolzote stood up to General Howard, and told him he would not obey. Yellow Wolf reported the final words:\nChief Toohoolhoolzote did not become afraid. His words were strong as he replied, 'I hear you! I have simiakia, that which belongs to a man! I am a man, and will not go! I will not leave my home, the land where I grew up!'\n\nFor this he was jailed..."

When they arrived at the camp the next day, most of the Nez Perce had departed for a campsite on White Bird Creek to await the response of General Howard. Joseph considered an appeal for peace to the Whites, but realized it would be useless after the raids. Howard then mobilized his military force and sent out 130 men, including 13 friendly Nez Perce scouts, under the command of Captain David Perry to punish the Nez Perce and force them onto the reservation.

 NA_N_nez_perce_war.9.d: "Chief Joseph seeks refuge for his people who have been branded as a non-treaty band. They are currently being pursued by the U.S. Military and have requested us to sanction their refuge within our territory. While we are sympathetic to their situation, accepting their refuge would put us in dire diplomatic relations with the United States.\n\nWhat shall our response to the [NEZ.GetName] be?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.9.a: "Tell them no. We cannot risk a diplomatic incident."

 ### Colorado War ###
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.t: "Revise the Treaty of Fort Laramie?"
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.d: "By the terms of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho, the Cheyenne and Arapaho were recognized to hold a vast territory encompassing the lands between the North Platte River and Arkansas River and eastward from the Rocky Mountains to western Kansas. However, the discovery of gold within the Rocky Mountains brought on a gold rush and a consequent flood of white emigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.\n\nColorado territorial officials are pressuring federal authorities to redefine the extent of Indians treaty lands. This task, if accepted, would be up to A.B. Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who will arrive at Bent's New Fort along the Arkansas River to negotiate a new treaty."
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.a: "Send the chiefs gifts, that will persuade them to sign..."
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.b: "Decline the revision, we will maintain the current treaty."
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.2.t: "The Treaty of Fort Wise"
 NA_N_colorado_war.2.d: "Six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States, at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers, recently leased by the U.S. Government and renamed Fort Wise, in which they ceded to the United States most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty. The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nMany Cheyenne claim the signature is illegitimate due to it not being made with a consensus of all tribe members. Though these resisters shall be marked as hostile and assumed to be planning for war."
 NA_N_colorado_war.2.a: "Well, a signature is a signature!"
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.3.t: "The Treaty of Fort Wise"
 NA_N_colorado_war.3.d: "Six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States, at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers, recently leased by the U.S. Government and renamed Fort Wise, in which they ceded to the United States most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty. The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nThe new reserve, less than one-thirteenth the size of the 1851 reserve, was located in eastern Colorado along the Arkansas River between the northern boundary of New Mexico and Sand Creek. Many Cheyennes are opposed to the treaty. That it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a 'solemn obligation' and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war."
 NA_N_colorado_war.3.a: "We shall ignore this illegitimate treaty!"
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.t: "Reports of Stolen Cattle and Attacks"
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.d: "Colonel John Chivington, commander of the Colorado volunteers, reports that Cheyenne Indians have stolen 175 heads of cattle from our settlers."
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.a: "Let him investigate, we must protect our settlements!"
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.b: "Tell Colonel Chivington he's needed more on the front lines."
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.c: "He'll threaten the treaties! Tell him to stand down!"

 NA_N_colorado_war.6.t: "Razing of the Cheyenne Encampment"
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.d: "Lt. George Eayre, under the command of Colonel John M. Chivington, despatched a force to recover the stolen cattle. Eayre then encountered a band of Cheyenne, which a fight then ensued and a Colorado soldier was killed. In retaliation, Eayre burned seventy tipis of a nearby Cheyenne encampment and returned to Denver with only 20 of the reported 175 heads of stolen cattle.\n\nThough the Cheyennes contest our reports, claiming they found the cattle wandering freely on the plains. Thus it was free to take the cattle into their encampments. Who do we believe?"
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.a: "How could we believe the Cheyenne? They've been raiding villages lately..."
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.b: "We shall relocate Colonel John M. Chivington to a different post at once."
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.7.t: "Slaughter of the Cheyenne Encampment"
 NA_N_colorado_war.7.d: "Lt. George Eayre, under the command of Colonel John M. Chivington, despatched a force to recover the stolen cattle. Eayre then encountered a band of Cheyenne, which a fight then ensued and a Colorado soldier was killed. In retaliation, Eayre burned seventy tipis of a nearby Cheyenne encampment and returned to Denver with only 20 of the reported 175 heads of stolen cattle.\n\nWe obviously contested this report upon the altercation, that these cattle where wandering freely on the plains. Thus it was free to take the cattle into their encampments, but they did not believe us and the argument escalated to self-defense when the soldier proceeded to take our cattle without our consent."
 NA_N_colorado_war.7.a: "How hollow is a man to raze everything... over claimed cattle?"
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.9.t: "Chivington's Cheyenne War"
 NA_N_colorado_war.9.d: "Lt. Eayre was in the field again with 100 men and 2 howitzers. Near the Smoky Hill River in Kansas, Eayre had a battle with the Dog Soldiers. He claimed the Indians started the battle; the Indians claimed the soldiers attacked them. Eayre claimed that he killed 28 Indians at a loss of four men of his own. George Bent claimed that only three Indians were killed, but among the Indian dead was Lean Bear, a prominent Dog Soldier leader. Eayre finished his raid on an encampment near Fort Larned, where 240 of his horses and mules were stolen by the Kiowa. Arapahoes offering assistance to recover the stolen horses were fired on by Colorado soldiers and thereafter turned hostile.\n\nThe Cheyenne report a different story. Less than 15 months after meeting President Lincoln in Washington, Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites. What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to 'kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.' Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground..."

### LANCER'S STUFF FUCK OFF ###

nativeindustrial.1.t: "Trading tomahawk for wrench."
nativeindustrial.1.d: "When one thinks 'native american', the next thing to follow isn't normally 'keen mechanical engineer'. However, with a surplus of disused railroads left by the Americans after their eviction, a group of the latest products from our new school system have taken it upon themselves to build trains and wagons for them. Who knows? Maybe they'll even make those new horseless carriages that are popular in Europe at the moment aswell."
nativeindustrial.1.a: "Interesting"

nativeindustrial.2.t: "A different kind of smoke signal."
nativeindustrial.2.d: "When the Yankees left, they left behind a network of telegraph cables that needed managing. Sioux Telegraphy was started to manage these and run sevices between towns, but has since grown much larger to become the main source of electronic research in the area. Last we heard, they had a simple electromechanical computer up and running, acting as an automatic switchboard for urban telephone connections in the capital city."
nativeindustrial.2.a: "First by cable, soon by air."

nativeindustrial.3.t: "The genius of the plains."
nativeindustrial.3.d: "Wilson Red-Fox was the chief of a large town in south dakota, notable for two things, weighing as much as a small horse and being a hobby chemist who experimented with synthesizing chemicals in his spare time with books he had found whilst raiding settlers. He is now considered an era-defining genius by many, having developed the Wilson Process, a method of extracting celluloid polymers from corn and wheat agricultural waste. His chemical business now manufactures everything from industrial pesticides to plastics and synthetic rubbers."
nativeindustrial.3.a: "He is rather clever, isn't he?"

nativeindustrial.4.t: "From slave to master."
nativeindustrial.4.d: "William 'Big Billy' Watts was born a slave and grew up a slave. But, in the chaos of the collapse of the confederation he was able to escape to Texas, where he started a small drilling well with what little he had in the budding oil industry. Now, he owns fields of wells and several large prototype refineries. One of the true rags-to-riches stories, palm petro-chemical specialises in petroleum chemistr and resource recovery, branching out from oil into mineral and lumber resources too."

nativeindustrial.5.t: "From failed gloves to vehicle parts"

This city will be built around a central circus 2km in diameter, within which will be contained the world's largest totem pole and area of worship, a colossal offering to our gods and ancestors, and an incredible monument to our power and wealth. The only question that remains, is whether we should rename the city or keep the old one?"

nativepolitical.6.d: "There was a flash, as the bomb went off on the range. It was a new guidance system they were testing, some kind of gyroscope. The shamans in their white coats and overalls stood shoulder to shoulder with generals and chiefs. One evening, long ago, an elderly Cherokee Brave told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, 'My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all.  One is evil.  It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt,resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.' The grandson thought abut it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, 'Which wolf wins?' The old Cherokee simply replied, 'The one you feed.' There was a low drone as the test plane zipped overhead, and a crackle on the radio of the pilot asking for his next orders. The general gave the go-ahead and moments later the second bomb touched down on the range. There was a crack, and then a flash."

While our population is steadily growing now the threat of disease and violence has been removed, the Americans in internment camps outnumber us, and the only difference between us and them is that we have guns. Things have been easier in the south, as our integrated 'Afrikana' natives have been more than happy to help us detain their previous masters. Then there is the cost, the need for ships, and the diplomatic tension this may cause. But if we want our land back, we need to remove the intruders."

nativepolitical.11.d: "After collecting the African-American population in the deep south into localised groups, the authorities asked them to choose a representative. These representatives were convened in the function room above a bar in a makeshift congress, and offered a choice/: take up the offer of citizenship and remain in the Americas, or take up the offer to be re-patriated to Africa. The choice was theirs. After many hours of deliberation on the matter of rights and legislation, the representatives returned to their communities to deliver the choice. These were not statesmen, nor were they intellectuals, but in this vein of strange history they would be the ones who would decide the future of the Black man on the American continent."
nativepolitical.11.a: "And now we wait..."

nativepolitical.12.t: "The Second Convention"
nativepolitical.12.d: "The second convention was held in the same bar, when the representatives returned to give their responses. To tell the truth, many of the African-Americans found the legislation to be sufficient for a myriad of reasons. Many were tired and wanted a more stable life, some felt it was more than the Americans had offered them. Some were more enthusiastic to take up the offer, as they had fought their former masters in revolts, or with the native army. Some saw no future for themselves in America, and opted to board ships to Liberia. At the end of it all, it was yet to bee seen whether the new native government had made valuable allies or simply a relationship of convenience. This would be decided in the coming years."
nativepolitical.12.a: "Results truly yet to be seen"

nativepolitical.13.t: "Ratification Of The African Legislation"
nativepolitical.13.d: "While we have made great progress towards integrating the African-American population, there's a wrinkle/: Rain-In-Face. Distinguished in the military, and now the chief representing his province, he has a few interesting views on other races and says he'd like to make them known. In short, he is threatening to filibuster the proceedings on the ratification of the legislation. Now, while it's obviously to our detriment, techinically speaking he is allowed to talk as long as he pleases. However, the chair of the African Convention and the council secretary agree that we've worked too long and hard to allow him to ruin it. We can arrange for an accident to befall him before the proceedings, and everything should run smoothly."
nativepolitical.13.a: "Quietly deal with him"

nativepolitical.14.t: "The Beginning Of An Odd Friendship"
nativepolitical.14.d: "We all know his thoughts on the black people. We all know ho long he could talk for. So it was fortunate that the night before, as he left a saloon, Rain-In-Face was clubbed in the head by an unknown assailant. While his condition is non-critical, and he'll certainly live, a few in the military circle are unhappy that a distiguished general was knocked around a bit. However, without him causing problems, the legislation passed the council without much distaste. All but a small minority are of the opinion that the African-Americans deserve their place by us, and the Convention is overjoyed."
nativepolitical.14.a: "Uncharacteristic of this time, but then we do that here."

nativepolitical.15.t: "An underwhelming Display Of Politics"
nativepolitical.15.d: "When Rain-In-Face took the stage, everyone in the council sighed. We all know his thoughts on the black people. We all know ho long he could talk for if he was allowed to, and the chief had already make it clear he would not cut anyone off. By the time the bloated windbag had finished talking, there was only 5 minutes left on the matter. It was only by a herculean effort by the integrationalist faction that the bill partially passed. It wasn't close to what they hoped for, and it wasn't close to what they agreed on, but it was something. The African-American community was dismayed. The convention was aghast. The strange alliance we had worked hard to forge had been ruined by one racist old bag of hot air and his ability to talk."

nativemilitary.3.d: "A wendigo, is an evil spirit which originates from the darkest folklore of this land. The Wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings. It is known to invoke feelings of insatiable greed/hunger in men, the desire to cannibalize other humans, as well as the propensity to commit murder in those that fall under its influence. The Wendigo is gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looks like a skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it has are tattered and bloody ... Unclean and suffering from decay of the flesh, and it gives off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption. This terrible creature stalks in the night, capturing an consuming it's prey, and is truly a figure to be feared. But it's just a myth, right? The truth is, stranger than fiction. These 'wendigo' are not mythical ravenous man-eating monsters, but men, dressed all in black, who hunt in the night. A battalion of soldiers specially trained in the mastery of night-fighting and hunting, and sworn to fight for their people until the very bitter end. These stalkers can track american troops for days, weeks even, calculating their number and understanding their behavior by what they leave behind. They can pull men from their tends, sabotage stores, release horses to run, and cause untold chaos behind enemy lines. Truly, the most feared monster here is in fact man."

Occurences like this are growing in number despite government attempts to control the situation, and aint-immigrant sentiment is at an all time high in what is now being referred to as the Atlantic Panic. Police are trying to control the situation, but a mob of local natives have gathered at the precinct and demand that the perpetrators be released to them so they can deal with it. The comissioner of the police has approached the council office of justice for it's advice, and adds that we must act quickly or things may get more out of hand than they already are."

However, this has not stopped the rolling boil of anti-immigrant sentiment. Many indiginous figures such as politicians and business leaders have thrown their lot in with the Anti-Colonial League, a group that espouses the belief that the new wave of immigration from europe is a plot by european powers to re-establish white man's rule over the american continent.

Boston has erupted into civil violence after a botched hostage-taking at city hall, when a group of league supporters took the mayor of Boston hostage in his office and demanded he approve their ordinance to segregate the city center. Minutes later, a group of Irish immigrants burst in, also wanting to take the mayor hostage in an attempt to broker the release of the Brooklyn Five from prison. This turned into a brawl, and with the help of some poor judgement calls from the police, the city is in total chaos. Someone has to be blamed so we can put this thing to rest."

This was after the arrest of many league sympathetic figures, and was met with condemnation in the rural heartlands where the league was most popular. The Anti-Colonial League has since declared that they will fight tooth and nail to bring this country back on the right track. While our handling was met with slight praise abroad, the League has promised violence towards outsiders, and our nation has become more and more viewed as unsafe for immigrants."
