    FRA_infantry_equipment_pre_rifle_3_desc: "In 1826, the Lieutenant Henri-Gustave Delvigne invented a new method for designing rifled guns. The chamber of the rifle was smaller than the bore, with which it was connected by a spherical surface equal in radius to the ball used. The powder was poured from the muzzle into the chamber, upon which the ball rested when dropped into the bore. When forced against the chamber rim by ramming (with three strokes of a heavy ram), the bullet would become deformed and flatten, so as to expand in diameter against the inside of the bore, allowing the bullet to press against the rifling grooves. When fired, the bullet would accompany the rifling and spin."

Despite its antiquated nature, it has remained as one of the most commonly used firearms of late Edo Period Japan."
