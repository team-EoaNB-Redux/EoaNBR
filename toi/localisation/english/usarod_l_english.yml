 # Formation of KKK
 acw_reconstruction.6.t: "Formation of the Ku Klux Klan"
 acw_reconstruction.6.desc: "In the city of Pulaski, Tennessee, a group of six former Confederate officers, Frank McCord, Richard Reed, John Lester, John Kennedy, J. Calvin Jones, and James Crowe, founded a group known as the "Ku Klux Klan." The KKK was a fraternal organization inspired by the "Sons of Malta." Throughout Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan perpetrated numerous atrocities against free black Americans, U.S. forces, and even elected officials. They did everything from thievery to murder to taking over government offices.\n\nAs the Federal government, it will be your job to deal with these terrorists, one way or another."
